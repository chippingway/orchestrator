"""One composed `cli.main` run with only its process-wide seams intercepted.

What is stood in for is what a test process cannot afford to run for real: the
GitHub clients, the workflow engine behind `workflow.tick`, the analytics
prune, the logging configuration, and the signal registration. Everything the
composition itself decides -- the order the owners run in, the state they
share, the live scheduler every tick is handed, and the exit code the run ends
at -- is the real thing, because that is what these tests are about.

The checkout root is redirected for the same reason the analytics sinks are:
a composed run claims this host for its whole life, on a real `flock` under
`WORKTREES_DIR`. Left pointing at the operator's own root, these tests would
create a lock file in it and -- worse than the litter -- a real maintenance
pass holding that host would have every one of them waiting on it, which is
exactly what that claim is built to make a process do.
