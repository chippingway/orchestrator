"""The launch that reclaims artifacts and does nothing else.

Composed the same way the polling run is -- one state, the handler, one
scheduler, the guaranteed drain -- because a run that deletes checkouts is
stopped by a signal exactly as a polling one is. What it must NOT do is the
whole point of the mode: no label bootstrap on the way in, no tick, and no
workflow write to any repository it was pointed at.

Nor may it act at all on a host another orchestrator process is live on. That
claim is real in every case here, because it is the only coordination in this
tree that reaches a process this one cannot see -- and the scheduler barrier
inside it, being one process's own, would grant the quiet of an empty process
however busy the other one is. The checkout root it is taken under is the
composed run's own, which is also why a test that contends for the claim takes
its own from INSIDE that run: outside it, the two would be claiming different
hosts and would agree about everything.

The pass itself is intercepted. What it does is settled in
`tests/runtime/test_artifacts.py` against stood-in collaborators; letting the
real one run from this composition would put a live discovery over the
operator's own clones inside a unit test.
