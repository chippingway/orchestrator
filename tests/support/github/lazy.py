"""A pull request that fails where a real one does: past the lookup.

The other doubles here are records -- what GitHub holds, spelled as fields. This
one is a behaviour: PyGithub hands back a lazy object, so `get_pr` asks GitHub
nothing and the requests that can fail are the attribute accesses behind it. A
guard around the lookup alone therefore covers none of them, and that is the
shape this double exists to reproduce.
