"""The id space every comment this double hands out is numbered in.

One ascending space per client, shared by every thread, by the pinned records
beside them, and by the pull requests those threads belong to, because that is
the space GitHub numbers issue comments in. A double that numbers a thread
from its own comments instead gives two threads the same id and puts a seeded
reply below a record minted after it -- and the orchestrator reads a thread by
comparing ids, so a case written against that double asserts on an ordering
production never has.
