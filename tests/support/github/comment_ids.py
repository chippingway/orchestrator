"""The one id space every comment this double hands out is numbered in.

GitHub numbers issue comments in a single ascending space per repository, and
the orchestrator reads a thread by COMPARING those ids: a watermark says
everything at or below it has been read, and a comment posted after a reply
lands above it. A double that numbers each thread from its own comments, or
that mints pinned records and pull-request comments from a counter the threads
never move, reproduces neither -- it hands two threads the same id, puts a
seeded reply below a record minted after it, and makes every bug that turns on
that ordering invisible.

So there is exactly one allocator and every id comes out of it. It sits in its
own module rather than on the issue-comment service because the pull-request
service and the pinned-record service mint ids too, and an allocator owned by
one of the three is one the other two are free to bypass.
