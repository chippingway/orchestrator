"""The operator authorization a settled exemption carries, written once.

An exemption is half a bypass: the size gate publishes a commit without a
reading only where the terms an operator authorized name it too, and the
rewrite transfer moves one only where the same is true of the commit it came
from. So every fixture that puts an accepted candidate in front of either has
to seed both, and they reach the writer through here rather than each spelling
the group out -- a seed short of a member is not an authorization, and a
fixture that drifted into one would be testing the legacy road while claiming
to test the settled one.

A seed carrying the exemption alone is that LEGACY road: the shape a `single`
verdict left before a human's own decision was required at publication. Cases
about it ask for it by name.
