"""A real repository whose branch is replayed onto a base that moved.

The one scenario a mocked reading cannot settle. Whether a rebase carried a
change a human already adjudicated is a question about BYTES -- the fork point
git resolves for each end, and the canonical digest of the contribution
between them -- and every double that stands in for either answers whatever a
case seeded rather than what the objects say.

So this builds the world instead: a base branch, a topic commit over it, a
base that advances, and a real `git rebase` onto the new tip. Two shapes come
out of it. The REPLAYED one is history-only -- the same work over a base that
moved -- and the AMENDED one is that same replay with a single byte written
into it, which is what a resolution somebody authored looks like to every
reader downstream.

Shared rather than owned by either caller, because the probe that reads the
fork points and the transfer that decides on them are tested from the two
packages those owners live in, and a second copy of this repository would let
one drift from the other.
