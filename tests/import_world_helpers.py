"""Keep one `orchestrator.config` object installed across a reload test.

A reload test pops modules so a re-import re-runs against a patched
environment. What it must not leave behind is a rebuilt `orchestrator.config`:
dozens of unrelated modules bind that module object once, at their own import
time, so a swap splits them into two camps -- whoever imported before the swap
holds one object, whoever imports after holds the other. A
`patch.object(config, ...)` then reaches only one camp and the other keeps
answering with the real settings. Which module lands in which camp depends on
when it happened to be first imported, so the symptom is a test that passes
alone and fails in a full run.

The reloaded module itself is still what the test drives; only the process-wide
binding is put back. Restoring `sys.modules` alone would not do it: importing
`orchestrator.config` also rebinds `config` on the persistent `orchestrator`
package object, so a later `from orchestrator import config` would resolve the
discarded reload straight out of the package namespace.
