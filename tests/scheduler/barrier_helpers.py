"""The live scheduler a barrier test drives, and the claims it holds on it.

The two things the hold waits on are reached from different places: a counted
worker is what ``submit`` puts in the pool, and a tracked claim is what a
handler already running takes for itself. A test that only ever went through
``submit`` could not tell the two apart, so the claim here is taken on a bare
thread and given back on demand.

Nothing about the scheduler itself is doubled. What the hold is worth is
decided by the executor and the two claim sets, so a stand-in for either would
hand the fixture's own answer back.
