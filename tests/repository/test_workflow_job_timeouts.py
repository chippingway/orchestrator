"""The wall-clock ceiling every workflow job runs under.

A job that hangs -- a network read that never returns, an action waiting on
input no one is there to give, a suite that deadlocks -- runs until GitHub
cancels it six hours later, and both halves of this set pay for that wait. CI
and the dependency review are required checks and CodeQL's findings are
enforced by a code-scanning ruleset, so a hung job holds a merge for those six
hours instead of failing in the minutes the run takes. Scorecard, the
vulnerability scan, and CodeQL's scheduled pass have nobody watching, so a hung
one holds a runner while reading as a run that has yet to report rather than as
one that failed. A job-level `timeout-minutes` is what bounds either wait to the
window the job is expected to finish in.

Nothing in the tree runs these files -- GitHub does -- so a job added or
rewritten without one would otherwise go unnoticed until the run that hangs.

The ceiling below is what keeps a declared timeout from being a restatement:
GitHub already cancels a job at 360 minutes, so a value at or past that is the
platform default under another name.

The list below is held against the directory rather than trusted as the whole
of it, so a workflow added beside these arrives with a timeout instead of
sitting outside every check here.
