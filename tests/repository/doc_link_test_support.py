"""The scan behind the documentation link checks.

Three questions are asked of one set of pages -- every relative path names
something the repository has, every `#anchor` names a heading that exists, and
every page under `docs/` is reachable from the index -- so the walk answering
them sits beside the checks rather than inside one of them.

Notes under `plans/` are deliberately outside the set. They are human working
material, not part of the reference hierarchy, and they name paths the code has
since moved away from; scanning them would fail the suite over a file nobody is
asked to keep current.
