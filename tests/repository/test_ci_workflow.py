"""What the CI workflow declares beyond the commands it runs.

Three of its decisions are invisible to every other check here, and each one
changes what a green run means.

The concurrency block decides which run survives. A pull request is grouped by
its ref and cancelled in progress, so a second push drops the run its own
earlier push started instead of leaving it racing the head that replaced it.
Every other run is grouped by its run id, which is what makes a push to `main`
uncancellable: `cancel-in-progress: false` protects a run that has started,
but GitHub holds one pending run per group and cancels the one a newcomer
replaces, so a shared group would still let a third push evict a queued `main`
run. A run there is the record of what the merged commit does, and a group
nothing else can enter is what keeps it.

The interpreter matrix decides what "the tests passed" covers. It names the
versions a run proves rather than the ones the distribution admits --
`requires-python` sets a floor and no ceiling -- so the floor is the one end
held against the manifest below.

The packaging steps decide whether the distribution works at all. The steps
above them reach the console script through an editable install of the source
tree, which says nothing about what the build backend packaged, so a wheel
that ships no package, an entry point naming a module it does not carry, or a
runtime dependency only the lockfile supplies stays green until someone
installs the distribution.

Nothing in the tree runs this file -- GitHub does -- so each decision is held
as the text GitHub has to receive.
