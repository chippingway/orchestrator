"""The pinned fields a held candidate's route bookkeeping may close.

The late domain spells that vocabulary as literals so it does not import the
four stage packages that own these keys, and that is exactly what lets the two
drift. Caught here, a key added to a route without being added to the reader
fails a test; missed, it fails at a RETRY -- where an unknown member makes the
reader drop the whole group, so a hold's round is never closed and the next
re-entry reruns a developer over feedback that was already answered.
