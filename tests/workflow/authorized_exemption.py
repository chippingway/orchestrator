"""The pinned fields a settlement an operator authorized leaves behind.

An oversized candidate publishes without a reading only where two records
name it: the exemption an adjudication's settlement wrote, and the terms an
operator authorized that publication on. Every stage whose tests put an
accepted commit in front of the size gate needs both, so they are spelled once
here rather than once per stage -- a seed carrying the exemption alone is the
LEGACY shape, and cases about that ask for it by name.

The terms one is granted on are the writer's under `tests/support/`, since the
stage fixtures here and the git-side ones have to agree about them.
