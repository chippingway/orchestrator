"""A real per-issue checkout, at the path a validating tick derives for one.

The seam a stage test usually stands in for is the one a squash recovery has
most at stake in: the WORKTREE. So this builds it -- a bare remote, the parent
clone every worktree of it is added from, and a genuine `git worktree` under
the configured worktrees root, on the branch a reviewer approved.

The path matters as much as the repository. What the stage looks for is
`_worktree_path(spec, issue)`, and what an ordinary preparation does to a
checkout carrying no commits over its base is remove it -- so a fixture that
handed the owner some other directory would answer a question nobody asks.
