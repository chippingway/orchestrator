"""Where the recorded-collapse route sits in a validating tick, and why.

A squash this issue began and did not finish is answered before anything else
on the tick runs an agent. Asked only from the approval road it would be asked
on no tick whose reviewer times out, crashes, or votes CHANGES_REQUESTED: an
already-landed collapse would never get its notice, its watermarks, or its
relabel, a record nothing can read would reach `fixing` without the park it
owes, and a body edit would resume the dev on a branch standing on a commit
nobody accounted for.

The park is the other half of owning the tick, and the two kinds are answered
differently. This recovery's own park is retried every tick and mentions
nobody twice -- what its notice asks for is proved by the recovery getting
further, not by a reply. A park the size gate worded is held instead, since
the gate says its own piece on every reading it cannot take, and the reply to
one is spent on the recovery rather than on the dev, who would otherwise be
resumed on the very branch the record is about.
