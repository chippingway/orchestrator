"""The order the approval handoff makes its durable moves in.

A squash that landed leaves a record of the collapse standing on the pinned
comment, because the count it holds is what the notice behind it is worded
from and nothing else on the issue has one. What ends that record is the write
this handoff makes -- and that write has to land BEFORE the relabel, since
past the label the issue belongs to `documenting`, a stage that never runs the
squash recovery and would carry a claim nothing there could ever answer.

The relabel is a second call, though, and it can fail on its own. So the write
does not leave the boundary empty: what it ends is the CLAIM, and what it
leaves in its place is the commit the move is owed over, which the route ahead
of the next reviewer reads to move the label instead of a second review being
run over a branch already approved, squashed, and published. That record is
dropped behind the label, in a write of its own.

The notice is the other end of the same rule. A post that was owed and did not
go out leaves the count still needed, so the record stays, the label stays,
and the next tick republishes the commit the remote already carries as the
leased no-op it is and words the notice again.
