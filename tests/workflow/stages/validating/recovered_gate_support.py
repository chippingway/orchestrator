"""One whole tick that publishes what a transient `validating` park stranded.

The fixture both silent recoveries are driven through. Neither has an agent
behind it: the issue is parked, no comment arrived, and what the tick does is
push a commit an earlier round left on the branch -- so the world every case
here seeds is the world AFTER that round, and the only thing a case spells is
the fact it is about.

It is a `validating` scenario and lives with that stage's tests because what
it seeds and runs is this stage's handler, whichever seam the case is aimed
at.
