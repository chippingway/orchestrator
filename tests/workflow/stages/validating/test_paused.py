"""Live `paused` guard for the validating stage: an operator who applies
`paused` (or `backlog`) WHILE a dev resume is in flight freezes the issue
before the resume's result handler runs. The guard re-fetches the issue after
the resume returns (`gh.get_issue`) rather than trusting the handler's label
snapshot, and on a hit the handler returns without posting the ack, pushing,
bumping `review_round`, relabeling, or writing pinned state -- so once the
label is removed a later tick republishes the committed work normally. Covers
the three validating dev resumes: the user-content drift resume, the
awaiting-human resume, and the CHANGES_REQUESTED reviewer-feedback fix.

The reviewer-feedback route carries its promise one tick further than the
other two, which is why it is followed past the pause here: the round it
discarded is anchored on a comment the orchestrator authored, so nothing
re-runs the dev on it and the first `fixing` tick after the label comes off is
the one that has to publish what the discarded run committed."""
