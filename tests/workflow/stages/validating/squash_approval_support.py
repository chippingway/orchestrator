"""The approved issue a squash-on-approval tick runs over, and its doubles.

One seeded issue, one pull request, and one run of the validating handler with
the squash seam standing in for the real rewrite. Every case about what the
approval arc does with a squash outcome -- the handoff it earns, the park a
failure takes, the hold the size gate answers with, the route a recorded
collapse takes ahead of every agent -- starts from exactly this world, so it is
seeded here rather than in whichever module happened to need it first.

The collapse world beside it is the same seeding one step on: what a comment
carrying an unfinished squash, a park nobody has answered, an edited body, or a
human reply looks like, and the squash outcomes those cases are run against.
