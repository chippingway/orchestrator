"""What this stage's content updates owe the pull request they join.

Every commit `workflow:resolving_conflict` publishes goes onto a pull request
the remote already carries -- a clean rebase that produced a new head, a
resolution an agent wrote, a body edit resolved into a commit, and commits a
crashed tick left unpushed. None of them is a diff of its own to the reviewer
who reads the result: what a push produces is everything the pull request
comes to with the commit in it, which is why the reading the size gate takes
is three-dot from the base the REMOTE names rather than from the head the pull
request was standing on.

The four windows that reading opens are what these pin down. A reading nobody
could take leaves a pair frozen with no count on it, and the tick ahead of the
next handler is what answers it -- without re-rebasing and without re-running
the agent that already finished. A candidate the count comes back over is HELD
rather than pushed, which ends the tick on `workflow:decomposing` with the
round this stage was in the middle of recorded for the tick that resumes
behind the settlement. A publication that MOVED between the freeze and the
reading that answers it is refused rather than measured against a pull request
the pair was never taken on. And a rebase that changed no head never enters the
gate at all: there is nothing to publish, so there is nothing to measure, and
the round it counts is the one that keeps a permanently-unmergeable pull
request from looping forever.
