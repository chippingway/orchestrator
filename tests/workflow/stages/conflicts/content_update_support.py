"""The record a conflict tick's own size reading leaves half-finished.

The freeze is durable and the count that follows it is not, so the crash this
fixture stands for lands between them: a generation naming both commits, the
publication it was entered on, and no number at all. Every case about a retry,
or about a publication that moved while the pair was outstanding, starts from
exactly that comment.

It is the one door those cases reach this stage's fixtures through, so the
scenario mixin and the heads a publication can be standing on come back out of
it beside the record.

Written through the domain's own writer rather than spelled as a dict, so what
a test seeds is what the freeze would really have left -- the marker included,
which is what tells an entry taken past publication from one taken before it.
