"""A conflict-stage replay decided over a real repository and real bytes.

The claim this seam rests on is one about content: a rebase that replayed an
adjudicated commit onto a base that moved carries the SAME contribution, and
anything that moved a covered byte carries a different one. Neither half can
be settled by a case that seeds the digests, because a seeded digest answers
what the case said rather than what the objects hold.

So both readings here are the real ones -- git's own fork points at each end,
git's own rebase between them, and the canonical fingerprint taken over the
actual trees and blobs. Only the two the fixture has no token for are stood
in: the remote-side base freeze, and the authenticated push.

The pair of outcomes is the whole point. The replay earns the permit and
publishes without a reading, so the change a human ruled on is not ruled on
twice. The same replay with ONE byte written into it earns nothing, is
measured like any other candidate, and past the ceiling goes back to the
adjudication -- which is what any change nobody has seen is owed.
