"""The one adjudicated branch this stage's replay tests rebase and publish.

A `single` verdict has already accepted the commit the pull request is standing
on, so the checkout, the remote, and the exemption all name the same object --
which is what a live issue looks like when its base moves under an approved
change. Every case here is that world with one thing replaced: the contribution
the replay produced, the fork points either end was read over, or the record
the exemption carries beside it.

The two comments a CRASH leaves are seeded from here too, because both are
that same world one write on and between them they are the whole of what
carries an exemption across a tick boundary. A rebase records what it is about
to replace before it runs and the commit it produced before it reaches the
gate; the gate's own grant then records the permission and the debt before the
push. So a tick that finds the replayed commit unpushed is answered from one
of those records -- never from anything it can read off the branch.
