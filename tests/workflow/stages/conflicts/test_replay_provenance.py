"""What a conflict-stage replay records about the commit it replaced.

The two facts a rebase destroys: the head the branch was standing on, and the
fork point that head's contribution was read over. Neither survives the replay,
so the one caller that runs one reads them while the branch still has them and
carries them across. No other caller may build this record, because no other
knows what the commit it is publishing is -- which is why what a crash leaves
recoverable is the permission the rebase persists, not a reading of the branch.

Handed to the size gate they are what lets a change a human already adjudicated
be recognized in the object that replaced it. Handed in PARTIAL they would be
evidence no later reader could check, so an end nothing could name is answered
with no evidence at all rather than with a claim that has a hole in it.
