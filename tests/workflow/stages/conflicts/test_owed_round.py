"""When a round this stage owes is settled, and what may not run before it.

The receipt is one slot and the round in it is already published, so what
decides whether it is ever counted is ORDER. Two things it outranks would each
lose it. The `MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS` cap refuses another attempt, and a round
already finished and published is not one -- so a receipt recorded at the
ceiling, which the body-edit road can reach, would be refused with the
attempts and strand there. A dev resume -- a body edit or a human reply --
writes the same slot with its own commit, so one answered first records its
outcome over the round the adjudication already published.

One thing outranks the receipt in turn. A branch behind its remote is refused,
because what the tail hands `workflow:validating` is the CHECKOUT and the
reviewer spawned behind it reuses a worktree rather than fast-forwarding it --
so the round waits for a human to reconcile the branch rather than buying a
verdict taken over a commit the pull request has moved past.

The receipt itself, and the four content updates that write it, are in
`test_settled_round.py` beside this.
