"""The round a resolution earns when the size gate holds it off the PR.

A content update the gate sends to the adjudication is a round this stage
finished and could not publish: the commit is on the branch, a settled
`single` verdict publishes it from there, and the label comes back here with
the hand to `validating` still owed. What the resumed tick cannot work out for
itself is which of the four it was -- the branch it comes back to already
carries its base, which is the no-op flip's own reading and the one exit that
resolves nothing.

One pair holds one round, which is why nothing may start a fresh resume over a
receipt that is still standing: the second would write its outcome into the
slot the first is waiting in, and the round a settlement already published
would never be counted.
