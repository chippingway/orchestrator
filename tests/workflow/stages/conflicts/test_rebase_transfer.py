"""Whether a conflict-stage replay carries an adjudicated change with it.

The exemption a `single` verdict leaves names one commit, and this stage is the
one place a branch standing on that commit is still replayed onto a base that
has moved: the per-tick base refresh skips such a checkout and never drives
`workflow:resolving_conflict`. Measured afresh, the very change a human ruled
on crosses the same ceiling again on the last push before the merge button.

So the clean rebase -- the one publication here that replays HISTORY it ran
itself -- hands the gate the pair it replaced, and the exemption moves onto the
commit it produced. Nothing else here presents evidence. A resolution an agent
authored over conflicted files, unpushed fix commits a reroute sent over, and
whatever an earlier tick left for the ahead-only recovery to find are all
commits somebody ELSE made, and no reading off the branch tells them from a
replay -- being on base least of all, since that is one of the two shapes the
`fixing` reroute fires on. Each is measured, and an oversized one earns the
fresh adjudication it is owed.

What carries a transfer through a crash is the PERMISSION the rebase made
durable before its push, which names the exact commit its replay produced. The
recovery presents nothing and is answered from that record, so a commit no
such record names gets nothing however alike it fingerprints.

Beside all of it sits the case the seam turns on: a replay that changed a byte.
It presents evidence like any other, and the fingerprints refuse it -- which is
what keeps a transfer a claim about the CONTRIBUTION rather than about the
rebase having run.
