"""What a process that died inside the publication seam leaves on the record.

The seam records an authorization, takes the park off and consumes the command
DURABLY before this stage gets an answer back, so a rollback that lives only in
the frame that made the call is gone with the process. What the poll after the
crash has to find is the park, its reason and its watermark exactly as the
crash-free run leaves them -- and nothing at all where the seam published, the
one outcome the park is never put back from.

That outcome has a window of its own, and it is why the reading behind the
command is written down rather than applied on the way out: the handoff moves
the label, and everything this stage still holds past that line is on an issue
it never sees again.
