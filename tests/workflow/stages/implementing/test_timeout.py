"""Implementing-stage agent-timeout disposition and recovery.

A timed-out implementer can still have committed clean work (or a descendant
the timeout cleanup raced finishes the commit just after). The handler must
not strand that commit behind `awaiting_human`: a clean HEAD advance pushes
and opens the PR, a dirty advance parks for inspection, and a no-commit
timeout parks tagged `agent_timeout` + `pre_implement_sha` so the next tick
can publish a late-landing commit without a human comment."""
