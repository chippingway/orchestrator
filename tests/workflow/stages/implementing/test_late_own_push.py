"""When a receipt is evidence of THIS issue's own push having landed.

A pull request standing anywhere but where a call was entered is somebody
else's branch move, and every owner that freezes or proves a publication
refuses one. There is a carve-out, and it is the window a tick that pushed and
died before its own bookkeeping leaves: the remote is standing exactly where
this issue put it, so refusing that would stop the recovery that exists to
finish it.

Three owners rest on the carve-out -- the size gate's entry freeze, the
settlement's proof, and the squash resume -- and what they share is the rule
rather than the road. So the rule is pinned here, once, at the reader they all
call: a receipt excuses a moved head only when every member of the receipt
group says the push was this issue's, onto the publication the caller is
proving against.
