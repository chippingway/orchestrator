"""What a reading the size gate could not take costs, and how it is retried.

A candidate whose size is unknown is not a small one, so nothing is published
on the strength of one: the pair that was frozen stays on the record, the issue
parks with the reason it failed for, and the retry re-reads exactly that pair.
The evidence rules beside it are the same claim from the other end -- a
recorded SHA is what a later tick acts on, never whatever the branch or the
remote has become since.
