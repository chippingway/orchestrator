"""What a human's reply to a measurement park buys, and what it may not.

A bare `/orchestrator continue` buys a second reading of the EXACT pair that
was recorded and nothing else -- no agent, and no substitute for a commit the
record names. Guidance buys the opposite: the developer is resumed, and what
it leaves is judged against the floor the park left on the branch rather than
against the base, so a clarifying question is not answered by publishing the
work it was asked about.

Some readings never reach a human at all. A base this host could not get to is
the transport rather than the work, so a bounded number of them in a row are
counted on the record and nothing else is done: no park, no mention, and a
pair the next tick re-reads by itself.
