"""The one candidate the authorization park's tests are all about.

A commit exempt on a record no operator authorization stands behind: the shape
an older binary left on a live issue, where a `single` verdict wrote the
exemption by itself before a human's own decision was required at publication.
Every case here starts from that comment and differs only in what the reading
of the candidate then says, and in what a human has written on the park.

Beside the gate's own support module rather than inside it, because what these
seed is a different subject: that module is about what one committed candidate
earns from the size gate, and this is about what a record with nobody behind
it earns from the owner past it.
