"""Where a parked issue's committed work goes when the park is answered.

Every park the size gate takes is answered ahead of the spawn, because on all
three the work in question is committed already: the road below would buy a
second developer run for an implementation the first one finished. What each
hands its answer to is the same publication seam that work came out of, so a
recovery reaches exactly the outcomes a fresh disposition does and decides
nothing the gate would have decided.
