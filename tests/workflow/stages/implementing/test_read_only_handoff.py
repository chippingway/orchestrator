"""The tick that runs once the read-only relabel guard has said yes.

Accepting the relabel hands this stage a branch it did not build: a discussion
may be held on the branch its PR is open against, so the dev run starts on
commits that are already ahead of base. Everything here is a consequence of
that one fact -- what the checkout is restored from, what counts as work this
run produced, and how durable the acceptance has to be before the agent is
ever spawned.

The guard's own screening decisions are covered in `test_read_only_relabel.py`.
