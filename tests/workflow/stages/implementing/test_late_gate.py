"""The size gate between a committed candidate and the branch it publishes on.

Every clean committed candidate goes through one seam, so what these pin down
is what that seam decides once it has a number: a candidate at or below the
ceiling publishes and goes to review, one past it is held unpublished under the
adjudication label, and two are never measured at all -- the commit an
adjudication accepted, and every candidate while the switch is off. What a
reading nobody could take costs, and the evidence rules a retry re-reads it
under, are in the recovery module beside this one.
