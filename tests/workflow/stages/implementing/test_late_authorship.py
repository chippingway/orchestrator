"""Which comments on this park's thread are the orchestrator's own words.

Every road here posts before anything records having posted it, and a sentence
nothing can attribute is read as somebody's word: it becomes the last reply,
the park's reading hands the tick back, and the ordinary resume spawns a
developer against our own prose and consumes whatever a human wrote under it.

Two records answer that. The id goes down the instant each post returns. The
receipt covers the one API call in between, and what it commits to is the
SENTENCE -- the secret and the exact body it went out on -- so a reply quoting
that sentence answers nothing, carrying its author's words beside ours.
