"""The commit an approval owes a publication, and the checkout that carries it.

Between the write that approves a candidate and the push that publishes it,

retirement a small candidate earns and the exemption a `single` verdict
records both drop the generation that used to name it. So the commit is proved

that moved off it, and a host that never had it -- reach the same park and the
