"""A close that reaches a measured candidate before it is published.

The last thing the size gate does with a candidate it approved is retire the
record and hand the issue on -- a branch pushed, a pull request opened, and the
label moved to review. None of that may happen on an issue a human has closed,
and the poll that saw the close cannot always say so: the scheduler admits no
second worker for an issue one is already running, so the reading is latched
rather than handed over.

So the retirement is where the barrier goes, and it is asked twice. Once
before the write, for a close already latched. Once as the write CLOSES, for
the close that arrived inside it -- the window where the record has stopped
naming a cycle and the ending has nothing to be entered from, which is exactly
the interval a poll would otherwise drop its observation in.
