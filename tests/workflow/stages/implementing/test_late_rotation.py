"""What the receipt of a landed push does with the permission that licensed it.

The far end of the transfer, driven through the shared gated-publication push
tail rather than through the owner alone, because the two facts the settlement
turns on are made by that tail: the commit the push named, and the head the
entry froze the pull request at. Both roads a permit accounts for are here --
a remote still standing where the grant left it, and one a tick that pushed
and died before its receipt already moved -- and each is asserted on the
durable comment, the push the tail issued, and the one record it left.
