"""One snapshot decides both halves of the recorded pull request's question.

This stage asks two things about the pull request its record names, and they
are different facts about the same object. The HEAD says what it IS -- the
`discussion` stage's plan while it still stands on the commit that publication
put there, this stage's own work once anything here has pushed over it. The
STATE says what to DO about it -- `done` for a merge, `rejected` for a close
nobody merged.

A human can move either at any moment, so reading them apart is reading two
moments. Classified on one snapshot and finalized on another, a plan the
humans merged is closed `done` as delivered work, with no developer having
run and a design document standing in for the build.
