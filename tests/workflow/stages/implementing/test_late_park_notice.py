"""What a park nobody could measure says, and when it says it a second time.

The typed member is written for the code that branches on it, and on a thread
it is one word: `base_absent` and `diff_unpinnable` name two completely
different next moves -- a transport to wait out on one side, a checkout to
clean before any reading of it is worth taking on the other -- and a notice
that named only the member would leave a human to work out which they are
looking at. What these pin down is that it says so, and that what the step
wrote for itself travels the whole way with it -- onto the thread, and onto
both streams, where the run of readings a standing park holds silently is the
only account there is of a pair nobody can measure.

The other half is how often it is said. A park is re-read for as long as it
stands, and every one of those readings owes the thread nothing unless it has
something new to say: a retry stopping where the notice already said it stops
is a repeat nobody can answer any faster, and one stopping somewhere else is a
different next move that would otherwise never be mentioned at all.
