"""The handoff from a published plan, which arrives with a PR attached.

An issue relabeled here out of `discussion` can carry a PR that says what to
build rather than a build, and the humans agree to that design by merging it --
which is precisely when they relabel. So a merged recorded PR has to be read for
what it is, not for the fact that it merged: closing the issue as `done` on a
design document ends it before a developer has run.

Which record answers changes at one point: the durable handoff. Until it lands,
nothing here has pushed, so the plan-path record answers whatever the PR's head
is now. After it, the recorded commit answers against GitHub rather than against
a record this stage promises to clear, because a tick that pushes the dev's
commits onto that same PR and dies before persisting anything has already made
it an implementation, and the merge that follows has to finalize.

The handoff is therefore where the two have to meet, and `AmendedPlanHandoffTest`
is about the case that makes them: between the publication and the relabel the
humans have the design on a PR and may move its head -- a correction to the
Markdown, the base merged in to make it mergeable. That head is what the
developer must build on, and what has to stand in for the path record being
retired, or the next tick reads their own edit as an implementation.
