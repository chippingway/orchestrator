"""Fixtures for the read-only relabel guard and the handoff it accepts.

Both modules beside this one drive a whole implementing tick against an issue
an operator moved here while a `discussion` park was still on it, so they share
the seed and the two probes that decide what the guard sees.

The discussion stage's wire vocabulary is spelled out here rather than borrowed
from that stage's own test support: what these modules pin down is how THIS
stage reads pinned state it did not write, so the strings are part of the
contract under test and a shared constant would let a rename pass unnoticed on
the side that has to keep understanding it.

    The current body hash is seeded for a subtler reason. Without one the

    the same object -- it would persist whatever else the tick had staged and
    hide a handoff that was never durably written.

    A `park_reason` of `None` is the issue AFTER the guard accepted that
    relabel: the clear drops the flags durably before anything is spawned, so
    that is the only shape from which this stage can have pushed anything. Every
    other seeded value is overridable through `extra` for the same reason --
    what the guard leaves behind differs from what it was handed, and a test
    about the later shape has to be able to say so.
