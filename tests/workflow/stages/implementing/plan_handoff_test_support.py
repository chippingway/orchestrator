"""The plan PR an implementing tick can arrive carrying, in its two shapes.

An issue relabeled out of `discussion` reaches this stage with a pull request
that says what to BUILD rather than a build, and the two shapes it arrives in
are what every test here is seeded from: the relabel as the humans left it,
with the publication's park and records still standing, and the same issue once
this stage's own handoff has accepted it -- park gone, path record retired, and
the tip it certified sitting in `read_only_baseline_sha`.

The second is a durable state and not a momentary one. The handoff is written
before the developer runs and everything the tick stages after it is dropped by
an interruption on purpose, so an issue can sit there for polls at a time with
the design still on an open pull request the humans can move.

The tick that drives both is here too, since what differs between the cases is
never how it is run: the branch sits where publication left it and only the
head GitHub reports for that PR changes.
