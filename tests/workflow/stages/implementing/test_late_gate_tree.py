"""The tree a publication has to prove, at every boundary that reads it.

`HEAD` answers half of what "this checkout" is. The other half is what sits
around the commit, and it can change with the head never moving -- a
descendant the timeout cleanup raced, a second process, an operator -- so
every proof taken about the commit passes while the checkout stops being the
thing that was measured. Nothing downstream reads it again: the reviewer
treats loose work as work to publish, the squash rewrites it, and the docs
pass commits over it.

So the tree is proved three times, and proved rather than inferred: the list
form of the status read maps its own failure to "no paths", which is what a
clean tree reports too, and a push may not rest on a probe that never ran.
