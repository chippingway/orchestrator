"""One adjudicated candidate parked for the person nobody can show.

The fixture the authorization park's own contract is driven through, at both
altitudes it has to be asked at. Most of what the park promises is a thread
and a pinned comment -- which reply a reading acts on, what the record it
writes says, and how far it consumes -- and driving that through a whole stage
handler would put a publication seam between the case and the answer it is
asserting on. What the ROUTING promises is the opposite: that a parked tick
reaches the gate at all, and that the park survives whatever the real seam
does with it, neither of which a double in that seam's place can answer. So
`_run_tick` runs the whole handler over the same seeded issue.

The generation carries the PAIR and no count, which is exactly what the park
leaves: a record answering "oversized" is what this workflow means by an
adjudication in flight, and the dispatcher puts `workflow:decomposing` back
over one before any stage runs. So the reading is re-taken by the tick that
acts, and the count a case hands in is that tick's own.
