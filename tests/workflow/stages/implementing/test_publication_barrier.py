"""The last thing between an initial publication and work that has ended.

The stage terminal answers a pull request that was already over when the tick
opened. What it cannot answer is one that ends WHILE the tick runs: between
that reading and the push lie a developer run, a disposition, a size gate and
two checkout probes, and every one of them is time a poll on another worker
can find the world changing in.

Nothing downstream catches it either. The reuse behind this push is a lookup
by BRANCH, so a pull request that ended in the window answers nothing to it: a
second one is opened over the work and `pr_number` is overwritten with it,
which is how the pointer to what a human just decided is lost.

One ending is deliberately not one here. A `discussion` plan the humans have
settled is an agreement rather than a delivery, and what it licenses is an
implementation with a pull request of its own -- so it is never something this
push joins and never something it may be held back by.
