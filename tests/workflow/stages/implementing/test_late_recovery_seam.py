"""What a whole tick does with a standing park, through the real seam.

The routing beside this asks which road a parked tick takes, with the
publication seam held still. These ask what happens when it is not: a tree the
seam reads for a second time, a head it proves for itself, a reading the seam
takes of its own -- or cannot take at all -- and a command that lands between
this park's own reading of the thread and the generic resume's. A double in the
seam's place answers none of them.
