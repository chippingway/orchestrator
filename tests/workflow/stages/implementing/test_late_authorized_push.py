"""What an authorized oversized candidate leaves behind when it publishes.

The one road to a publication that does not go through the ordinary
settlement: a human authorizes a candidate the ceiling refused, so no count
lets it past and nothing below the gate's door is asked. Everything the
retirement exists for is still true of it -- a generation left standing
freezes this branch out of the ordinary base refresh for as long as the issue
lives, and the guard that ends a cycle on a close reads it as one still
running.
