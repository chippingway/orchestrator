"""What an operator wrote while a developer was running, and who consumes it.

Every other window on this park is between two of one tick's own steps, and
each is closed by asking its question once. This one is not: an agent takes
minutes, nothing reads the thread again while it does, and the park that ends
the run is the next thing to write down how far the thread has been read.

Stamped to whatever the thread ENDS on, that write is the notice the park just
posted -- above anything a human wrote during the run, which is then skipped
for good. On this stage the comment skipped can be the
`/orchestrator authorize-oversized` an adjudicated candidate is still waiting
for, and the road that could act on it never sees it.
