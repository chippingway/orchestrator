"""What the publication receipt vouches for, and what it may not.

`implementing_published_sha` is the note this stage leaves naming the commit it
pushed, and the window it exists for is the one between that push and a relabel
that never landed: the branch is on the remote, a pull request carries it, and
the record still says implementing. A tick reading that as fresh work would
measure a published commit and, finding it oversized, route it into an
adjudication with nothing left to hold back.

That window is real and nothing here closes it. What is proved is that the tick
is still IN it: the note says what this stage last pushed and nothing about
where it went or whether it is still there, and it is never cleared -- so a
branch published rounds ago carries one for the rest of the issue's life.
Answered on the note alone, the candidate skips the reading, is pushed
unmeasured and unleased, opens a SECOND pull request over work the first
already carries, and the issue is handed on as though all of it had been
published all along.

So the same proof stands behind every road that rests on it: the pull request
the record names, open, on the branch this seam would push, standing on this
exact commit. And because a reading is a moment, what the answer carries is the
NUMBER -- the push behind it is leased against that commit, and the bookkeeping
is bound to that pull request.
