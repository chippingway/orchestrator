"""A pull request grown one fix at a time, round after round.

What one round on its own cannot say. Every fix is measured against what the
pull request COMES TO, so a change arriving in pieces meets the ceiling the
same way one arriving at once does: rounds at or under it publish and hand the
issue back for another review, and the first round whose cumulative reading
passes it is held with the remote standing exactly where the last landed push
left it.

The rounds before that one are the point. A landed push leaves a receipt
naming its commit and retires the generation it was measured under, and each
of those names ONE commit -- so the next fix is a candidate nobody has ruled
on, measured afresh from the base the remote names rather than from the head
the round before it published.
