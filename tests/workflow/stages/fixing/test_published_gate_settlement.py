"""The debt an unmeasured publication records, and the write that pays it.

A candidate that skips the reading freezes no generation for itself, so between
the gate letting it through and the push that carries it there is committed
work on the branch and, without this, nothing on the issue naming it. The
measured road records that debt beside its retirement; these pin down that the
unmeasured roads -- an adjudication's exemption, a supersession the switch let
past -- record it too.

Both sides of the push are here because the windows are different. Before the
settlement write the branch may already be on the remote with nothing saying
so, and the debt is the whole of what a later tick has to go on. After it, the
receipt and the route's own bookkeeping are already durable and only the
caller's tail is missing.

The receipt is what makes the second window easy to miss: it is never cleared,
so a branch that has been on the remote before arrives with it already naming
the commit in hand. It says nothing about the round behind this push, and the
debt recorded ahead of the push is what the settlement reads instead.
