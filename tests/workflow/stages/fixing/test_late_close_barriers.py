"""Every barrier between work that ended and a push onto it.

The reconciliation that runs ahead of every stage ends in a PUSH -- the reading
it takes does, and the debt road beside it exists to make one -- while the
terminal that drains finished work runs inside the stage handler behind both.
So an ending reaching the orchestrator between the crash and the recovery is
the way work would otherwise land on a pull request nobody can merge.

Three facts answer it, and they are answered differently. The issue OBJECT and
the PULL REQUEST the record names are read at the reconciliation's door and the
tick is handed back: the handler's own terminal is next, and it marks the issue
`done` or `rejected` with the record, the branch and the debt left exactly as
they are. A pull request is the half the issue's flag cannot show -- a merge
leaves the issue open until a terminal reads it -- and it is read fail-OPEN
there, so a remote that would not answer costs a poll rather than stranding an
issue.

Everything the tick spends past that door -- a stage check, a checkout probe, a
remote read, a diff -- is time a poll on another worker can find the world
changing in. So the last barrier is inside the publication, immediately before
the push and nowhere else in it, and there the same pull-request reading fails
CLOSED: what falling through costs is a branch nothing can put back.
