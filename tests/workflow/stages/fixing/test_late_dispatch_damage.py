"""A record that claims a post-publication reading it cannot produce.

Every field in this domain is read fail-closed, and ahead of the HANDLER that
is only half an answer: a publication group missing one member parses as no
group and an approval missing its lease parses as no approval, so both of the
questions the reconciliation asks answer "nothing owed" and the stage runs
over a claim nothing can check.

What these pin down is that it does not. A reviewer spawned over a pull
request nobody can say received the work, a bounce relabelling on a candidate
nobody measured, a docs pass committing on top of either -- none of them may
follow a claim the record cannot make whole.
