"""What a crash between the freeze and the count owes, and where it survives.

A hold closes the bookkeeping its caller's tick was in the middle of -- the
reviewer round a fix spends, the bookmarks a consumed batch clears -- and the
caller says up front what that is, because the hold relabels and nothing
behind it would go back for the count. The freeze is durable and the count is
not, so a tick that dies in between leaves the reconciliation ahead of the
next handler to take the reading instead. That tick has no run behind it, so
there is nothing for it to re-derive any of this from: it is restored off the
pinned comment or it is lost.

Lost, an oversized retry routes to the adjudication having closed none of it,
and the pinned comment goes on naming a fix batch that was already answered.
