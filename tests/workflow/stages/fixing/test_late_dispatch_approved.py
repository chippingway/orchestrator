"""The push an approving tick could not land, finished by the next one.

The write that approves a small candidate retires the generation it was frozen
under, deliberately and before the push it licenses runs. A push that then
MISSES leaves three things behind and no tick able to use them: an approval
naming the commit, the route bookkeeping that approval carried past its own
retirement, and a park whose stage short-circuits on it before any handler
reads a thing.

So the reconciliation ahead of every handler is what finishes all three. It
publishes the commit the approval names, closes what the caller's own tail
would have closed, and releases the park the failed push left -- and where the
push misses again it does none of that and says nothing, because a mention
nobody can answer any faster is churn and a rewritten reason is a transient
park turned into one only a human clears.
