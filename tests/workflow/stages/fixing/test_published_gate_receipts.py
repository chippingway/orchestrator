"""The debt a gated push owes, and the window between it and the record.

Every gated push leaves two things behind: a receipt naming what reached the
remote, and no debt. Both go down in one durable write, because the effect is
already out -- and a process can die anywhere after it. What these pin down is
that window from both ends: the approval a failed push keeps and the head it
is pinned to, the receipt a crash lost being settled by the pull request that
is already standing on the commit, a receipt honoured only while the
publication it names still stands, and the checkout proved again on the far
side of the push.
