"""A pair frozen for a published pull request, answered before its stage runs.

The freeze is durable and the count that follows it is not, so a tick that
dies in between leaves a record naming both commits with no number on it. What
these pin down is that the next tick takes that reading first: the handler
below would otherwise spawn a reviewer, resume a developer, or read a pull
request still standing where the gate froze it, while the record goes on
freezing the branch out of the base refresh.
