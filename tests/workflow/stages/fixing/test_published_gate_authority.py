"""An adjudicated commit nobody authorized, on the side that already published.

The exemption an older binary wrote lets nothing past the size gate on its
own, and what that costs on a pull request the remote already carries is not
what it costs before one exists. A commit the pull request is standing on has
already been delivered: the push would move nothing, so what is left is the
bookkeeping behind it, and holding that back would strand published work under
a stage no later tick advances. A commit it is NOT standing on is an
unmeasured push waiting to happen, and it is measured and held like any other.
