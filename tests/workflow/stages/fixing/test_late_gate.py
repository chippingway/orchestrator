The fixing-specific half of the size gate's coverage: the second seam a
candidate reaches a published pull request through (the no-feedback bounce),
the checkout that is not on this host when that bounce runs, and the reviewer
round this loop spends whether its fix is pushed or held. The gate's own
contract is pinned beside its owner, in
