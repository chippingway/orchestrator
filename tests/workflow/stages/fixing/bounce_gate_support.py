"""The no-feedback bounce, driven with the post-publication size gate on.

The bounce is the one tick left that can publish a commit an earlier fixing
round stranded on the branch, and no agent runs on it: the reviewer feedback
that opened the round is orchestrator-authored, so every rescan filters it out.
That makes it a seam a candidate reaches a published pull request through with
nothing behind it having measured what the pull request would come to -- which
is what the fixture here seeds the gate in front of.

It shares the stranded fixture the route's other tests use and adds only what
a gated tick needs: the ceiling, the pinned fields a hold is handed to the
adjudication under, and the one window a closed pull request can arrive in.
