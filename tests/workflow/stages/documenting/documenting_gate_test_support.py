"""One docs pass driven onto a pull request the remote already carries.

The final documentation pass is the last push before a human is asked to
merge, so its commit is measured like every other candidate for an open pull
request: what that pull request COMES TO with the commit in it, against the
configured ceiling. The three roads a docs commit reaches that push by are
seeded here -- a fresh pass that committed, a commit an earlier tick stranded,
and a `DOCS: NO_CHANGE` reply that still has one waiting.

The values sit beside them because the gate's contract is one contract read
from several roads: the ceiling a case seeds, the commits it names, and the
pinned fields a hold and a landed push write are the same wherever the tick
entered from.
