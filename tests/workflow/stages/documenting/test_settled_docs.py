"""The docs commit the size gate measures, and the pass a hold leaves owed.

A docs pass is the last push before a human is asked to merge, so it is
measured like every other candidate for a pull request the remote already
carries. A hold ends the tick with the pass itself finished, which is what the
receipt here is about: the adjudication publishes the commit and hands the
label back, and the tick that gets it has to finish the handoff rather than
read a branch in sync with its remote as an issue no docs pass has run for.
