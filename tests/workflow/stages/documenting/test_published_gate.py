"""The docs commit measured before it joins a pull request that is open.

The final documentation pass is the last push before a human is asked to
merge, and what it publishes is not the docs commit's own diff -- it is
everything the pull request comes to with that commit in it. So the size gate
every other push onto an open pull request goes through stands in front of
this one too, on each road a docs commit arrives by: the fresh pass, the
commit an earlier tick stranded, and the `DOCS: NO_CHANGE` reply that still
has one waiting.

A hold is the end of the tick rather than a park: nothing is pushed, no docs
verdict is stamped, the issue goes to the adjudication instead of `in_review`,
and the head the pass produced is left as the receipt the handoff is still
owed. What the gate allows is pushed named to that commit and pinned to the
head the pass was entered on, and only then stamped, announced, and handed on.
