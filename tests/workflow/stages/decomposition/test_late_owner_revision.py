"""The developer side of the owner guard: what a finished revision may say.

The same read a finished adjudication passes, at the same point and for the
same reason -- the developer ran for as long as it ran, and a human who closed
the issue in between ended the whole cycle rather than this tick. What differs
is what the two ends of a revision owe the issue: a candidate re-measured and
a reconciliation that could not be made both have a sentence for a human, and
neither is said until the read comes back open.
