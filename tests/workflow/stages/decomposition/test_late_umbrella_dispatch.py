"""The umbrella a late split made, reached through the tick's own guards.

The transaction releases whichever children start immediately and stops. Every
child after those is released by the umbrella's own walk, on a later tick --
and every one of those ticks goes through the dispatcher first, which asks the
pinned comment whether anything is owed before the label's handler is called at
all.

What the retirement leaves on that comment is the publication group with no
count beside it, which is also the shape of a tick that died between the freeze
and the diff. The two are told apart by the record's own settlement. Without
that reading the group would name the stage the gate was entered from rather
than `workflow:umbrella`, every poll would be held for a human in front of the
walk, and a split's own children would be the one thing it can leave
permanently unreleased.

Driven from the transaction rather than from a seeded umbrella, so what the
dispatcher reads is the record the retirement actually writes.
