"""The fresh owner read a finished late run has to pass before it is acted on.

Three answers and three obligations: carry on, cancel the cycle, or record the
read as still owed. It is taken after EVERY completion -- the ones that decided
something and the ones that only parked -- because the run was paid for either
way and a closure during any of them strands the same generation and the same
plan-PR hold. What the park a failed read leaves does next is the module
beside this one.
