"""What an umbrella a split made owes the pull request that split closed.

The transaction is not the last thing to release a child of a published split.
It hands the issue to `umbrella` and stops; from then on the umbrella's own
walk releases them, on every tick until the manifest is done. Every one of
those releases is licensed by the pull request their work was superseded on
still being closed, and that pass is long gone -- so a human who reopens the
change afterwards would otherwise have its work handed over anyway.

Which is why the question is asked inside the walk rather than by whoever
called it: the child scan a caller decides on is a request per child, and the
relabels behind it are one request each, so a licence taken anywhere but
immediately in front of a relabel is one the relabel has already outlived.

And why the walk asks its own cheap barrier on BOTH sides of that question:
the licence costs a lookup, and a close a poll observed inside it would reach
nothing else before the relabel landed.

Which is what the retirement keeps the publication group for. The measurement
goes, because that is what pins `workflow:decomposing`; the pull request and
the head it was closed over stay, because they are the only thing on the issue
that could answer this question again.

Driven from the transaction rather than from a seeded umbrella, since what is
under test is the record the transaction actually leaves: a fixture that wrote
the group by hand would pass while the retirement dropped it.
