"""The publication a late generation was entered ON, seeded for a settlement.

A verdict taken past the first push is a claim about one pull request standing
on one head, and both are recorded on the generation rather than looked up. So
a test about that side seeds the pair together: the record carrying the whole
publication group, and the pull request it names.
