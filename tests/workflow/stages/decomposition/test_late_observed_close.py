"""The close no request this run could make would ever show it.

A poll that finds a late-split owner closed while a worker holds it can hand
that reading to no second worker, and a human who reopens the issue before the
next pass takes it off the remote for good. So the reading is latched, and the
run in flight asks the latch before every step the remote keeps: GitHub cannot
show it a close and a reopen that both happened inside one of its own steps,
and the latch can.

The steps here are the ADJUDICATION's: the spawn an oversized candidate pays
for, and the publication an accepted one earns. What the same latch does
between the steps that make a CHILD is `test_late_child_close`, and what a
process inheriting such a reading from a DEAD one does with it is
`test_late_inherited_close`, both beside this.

Every case here therefore runs against an issue GitHub reports OPEN. Nothing
the run could ask would stop it; the latch is the only thing that knows.
