"""The three parks that lose their sentence outright when a comment fails.

A park is durable before it is spoken, which is the order everything else in
this mode depends on -- and it leaves one gap. The flag lands, the comment is
refused, and every later tick reads an `awaiting_human` it cannot tell from
one whose comment landed: it takes the human as told and says nothing.

For the parks a fresh attempt supersedes that costs one tick and no more. For
these three it is unbounded. A categorized question, an edit nobody has
explained, and a checkout the developer left dirty ARE what the issue is
waiting on: no attempt re-takes them, so their own sentence is the only thing
that would ever say what the human has to do, and losing it leaves the issue
parked in silence for as long as nobody thinks to look.

Each is driven the same way -- one tick whose park lands and whose comment
does not, then the next tick, which has no agent to spend and must say the
sentence anyway.
