"""What a snapshot owner a human closed still owes, and who comes back for it.

An issue closed on `decomposing` or `umbrella` is outside every other pass, so
the cleanup sweep is the only thing that ever asks about its ledger again. The
real handler is driven in every case, because half of what is under test is
what the pass does NOT do: it never activates a child and never spawns. The
one label it does write is the `rejected` a fully settled cycle earns, which
is the ending rather than a route -- what that ending consists of is pinned in
`test_late_cancellation.py` beside the owner that decides it.
