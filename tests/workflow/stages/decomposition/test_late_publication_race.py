"""The close that lands while a cleared split is publishing itself.

Publication is not one moment. The parent says what it became, the held plan
pull request is closed over a supersession notice, and the retirement hands the
parent to `umbrella` -- three GitHub round-trips, each of which a human can
close the issue inside, and the last of which is followed immediately by the
one effect of the whole transaction that puts an agent on somebody's
repository. So the owner is read between them rather than once for all of them,
and this module is one gap at a time.

What each ending inherits differs, and that is the other half of the subject:
a cycle stopped at the supersession still owns a held pull request nobody has
told, and one stopped just past it owns a superseded branch the retirement
never got to write down.
