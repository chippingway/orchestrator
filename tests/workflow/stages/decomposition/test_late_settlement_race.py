"""What ends between the reconciliation that read it and the push itself.

A settled `single` taken past publication pushes from the settlement, and that
push reaches the transport directly rather than through the gated call every
other publication goes through. So the barrier that call makes has to be made
here too -- and the window it covers is the widest on any road: the pull
request was last read by the reconciliation, and the exemption, the identity,
the debt, the park persist and both checkout probes all run between that
reading and the push.

Nothing about an ending moves the branch. A pull request somebody merged or
closed in that window still has its branch exactly where the adjudication left
it, so the lease SUCCEEDS and the force-push moves terminal work -- a merge
commit's branch walked back onto the commits it merged. A close a poll latched
is the same answer one field over, and the issue object this tick is holding
still reads open, so the latch is the only thing that can answer for it.
