"""What the world answers a late run's probes with, and how it is held.

The seams a late adjudication would otherwise really reach are a checkout on
disk, a size measurement that shells out to git, and -- on a cleared `split`
alone -- a push and a fetch against a real remote. Every one of them is held,
and a case says which answers it is about by handing one of the two seeds
here; what is not asked about is held at the answer that lets the run proceed,
except the measurement, which is held at a failure because a test that reaches
it without saying what it expects has not decided anything.
