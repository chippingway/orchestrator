"""The agent run a late adjudication spends, and what its charge may carry.

The coordinator is the one spawning road that is not a dispatched handler, so
the table that holds every other road to the lifetime ledger cannot drive it
and this is where its half of that coverage lives. What it has to show is the
same thing: the adjudication reaches the charging boundary naming the issue it
is spending, and the spend is read back off that issue's own pinned comment.

The second case is what makes this road different from the rest. Everything
between the retry gate and the spawn is one transaction of the coordinator's
own -- the slot it charged is held in memory while the write that records the
attempt goes out without it, so a run the tick then declines costs the daily
budget nothing. The agent-run charge lands inside that window, and it writes
to the issue. Those two facts have to coexist: the run is durably paid for and
the slot the coordinator was holding out is still held out.
