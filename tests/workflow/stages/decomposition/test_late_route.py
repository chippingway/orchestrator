"""Which of the two questions a `decomposing` tick is about.

The label is shared. An issue that has still to be decomposed reaches the
initial decomposer, and one whose committed implementation was measured past
the ceiling reaches the late coordinator instead -- and nothing below that
route runs for it, because the candidate it is about lives in the developer's
own worktree rather than in the scratch checkout the initial decomposer needs.
