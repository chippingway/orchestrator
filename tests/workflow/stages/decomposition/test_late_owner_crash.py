"""What a tick that did not live to the end of the guard leaves behind.

Two boundaries, one obligation, so one set of cases run at both. The read is
CLAIMED before it is taken and the claim rides the write that records the
result -- so a process killed inside the read and one killed before any of the
guard runs both leave an issue that still owes the read. Derived from the
failure instead, a tick that never saw one would leave nothing, and a revised
candidate is exactly the result that carries the next tick past the point a
retry could hang off: under the ceiling it is not adjudicable, and over it the
advanced generation has no recorded answer to short-circuit the spawn.

"The write that records the result" is every completion's own, not the
verdict's alone, which is what the second and third cases here are about. A
timeout, an unusable reply, an outcome too large to record, a worktree the
read-only agent moved, and a developer reconciliation nobody could make are
all finished runs the issue paid for -- so the seam immediately before the
guard has to find each of them already durable, park and claim together. A
tick that died there having written nothing would leave a generation still
reading as `adjudicating`, and the next one would pay for another agent.
