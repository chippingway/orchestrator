"""What a human doing something while one pass is still running looks like.

Neither of the two subjects beside this one. A death is a tick that does not
live long enough to see anything fail and a refusal is a step that reported
back; here the process lives, every step reports back, and what goes stale is
a PROOF taken one round-trip ago. No ordering closes that window -- only a
reading taken again in front of the effect it licenses does -- so it is driven
from the seam a step has just finished at rather than by a death at one.

The lookup recorder is here for the same reason: what a pass may not do is
prove one pull request and act on another, and the only way to see that from
outside is to count what it asked GitHub for.
