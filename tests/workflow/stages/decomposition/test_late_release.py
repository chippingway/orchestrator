"""What a reclamation has to prove, and what it leaves on the children.

Two halves of one transaction. A delete is ordered on the record before it is
carried out, so a retry can finish one the remote already took -- but that
record buys the retry nothing about a ref the remote still has, which a child
reopened since may still be cutting from. And a delete that lands is not over
until every child cut from the ref has been told, because there may be no
later pass: an umbrella that settles everything closes as `done`, and nothing
revisits a `done` issue.

Told is a COMMENT and nothing else. This owner may not write a consumer's
pinned comment -- that is written whole by whoever writes it, and a handler of
the child's own would lose or undo whatever landed second. A comment is
appended, so nobody can lose it, and what acts on it is the child's own guard,
evaluated on the child's own dispatch (`test_late_reuse.py`).

Driven through the umbrella's real terminal, which is the entry that reaches
both on the ordinary path.
