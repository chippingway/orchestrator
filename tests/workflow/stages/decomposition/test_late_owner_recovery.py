"""The park an unreadable owner leaves, and how it gets itself out of one.

Nobody can answer "GitHub could not be asked", so the park a failed owner read
files is the one this mode has to clear itself. What brings a tick back to the
read is the pending check the generation records -- durable, and ahead of every
gate that would otherwise route past it -- and what it owes the thread once it
heals is one sentence retiring the mention it filed.
