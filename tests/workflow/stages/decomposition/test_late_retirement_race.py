"""The close a poll takes while a worker is retiring the cycle it names.

A published `single` ends by dropping its generation, and that write takes the
one thing every reader of a close consults: the cycle identity. A poll running
beside it asks the record whether there is a cycle a close would end, and a
poll that asks a moment too late is told there is not -- so it would drop the
reading, and the barrier the worker asks immediately behind its own write
would find nothing latched.

Both threads are real here. The worker publishes and retires through its own
owner; the poll runs the dispatcher's whole deferral -- observe, ask the
record, keep or drop, write the receipt -- from inside the retirement write.
What the cases pin is that the reading survives that ordering and that what it
leaves on the thread names the cycle it was taken against, which is the only
half of it a restart still has.
