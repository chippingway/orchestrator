"""The close a developer revision has to catch on both sides of its run.

A resumed developer is the same kind of step a spawn is -- an agent on
somebody's repository, paid for and free to decide -- and the run takes
minutes to hours, which is the whole window a latched close exists for. So the
latch is asked on both sides of it, because neither side covers the other: the
first stops a reading already standing from buying a run at all, and the
second stops the remeasure that would otherwise write a fresh candidate over a
cycle a close already ended.

A poisoned session is guarded separately. That retry exists so a transcript
GitHub's own backend lost does not cost the issue a park, and an issue
somebody has closed is owed neither: it is a SECOND agent against work nobody
wants.
