"""One guarded split whose candidate was measured on an existing publication.

The `late_transaction_support` fixture beside this one is the split itself.
What this adds is the side of publication it was entered on: no plan PR was
ever opened, and what the verdict was taken over is the implementation pull
request the work is already on.

Seeded unheld, which is the narrower of the two shapes a transaction meets: a
publication that was open when the adjudication started wears this cycle's
hold, and one settled by then does not. `held_publication` is the other.

Two seedings rather than one, because the road is entered from two depths: a
case is either handed the guarded split the transaction runs on, or drives a
whole tick at the coordinator and lets the hold, the run, and the transaction
happen to it.
