"""The close an umbrella's own walk has to catch for itself.

An umbrella poll reads every recorded child, and that is a request per child.
Everything past the scan ACTS on what it read: it reclaims a remote a settled
split still owes, or it hands the issue `done` and closes it, or it releases a
child to an agent. A close observed inside the scan reaches no other pass --
the scheduler admits no second worker for an issue one is already running --
so the walk is what has to stop.

`done` is the worst of the three, and it is why the barrier is here rather than
one layer down: that write takes the issue off both labels the closed-owner
sweep queries, so the cancellation would never be recorded by anything, ever.
