"""What a child born of a split proves before it starts work.

The owner that reclaimed the ref cannot make this safe from its side: it would
be writing another live issue's pinned comment from a worker of its own, and a
handler of the child's own that read that comment first and wrote it after
would undo whatever the owner recorded. So the decision is the child's, taken
on the child's own dispatch -- where there is nobody to race.

Driven through `_process_issue` rather than any one handler, because the issue
this is about is one no handler would touch: a consumer that ended wears `done`
or `rejected`, reopening leaves the label exactly where it was, and both are
terminal no-ops. What these cases pin down is that the park happens before any
of that is decided.

    """The two shapes this host's own copy cannot answer for.

    The free local read is bought by the reclamation's ordering and by the
    pointer being a whole one, and two shapes have neither.

    One is a pointer written before that ordering existed. An orchestrator
    that deleted the remote ref first and dropped this host's copy afterwards
    -- best-effort, and past the point of no return -- could leave a mirror
    standing beside a ref that is gone; every child of a split a repository
    ran before the upgrade carries such a pointer, no pass ever revisits its
    owner again, and the receipt that would settle it was never written
    either. So the stamp the split writes is what the shortcut is conditioned
    on.

    The other is a child whose ancestry seed failed, which records no pointer
    at all -- only the marker in its body. A body is a field the world can
    write, so what that marker buys is the right to ask rather than an answer:
    the OWNER's own record is read fresh, has to name the same cycle and
    generation, and has to carry this issue among the consumers it cut from
    that ref. Vouched, it hands over the whole pointer the failed seed never
    wrote -- the ref the identity mints and the commit the owner recorded
    preserving -- and the wire is asked about exactly that. Unvouched, the
    guard has nothing to say and steps aside; unanswerable, it holds.
