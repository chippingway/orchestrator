"""A late adjudication an issue has no agent runs left to pay for.

The road here reads the candidate worktree BEFORE it asks whether the run
happened, and for a good reason: a run the shutdown sweep killed can have
changed the candidate on its way out, and a contaminated candidate is a thing
an operator has to be told about. A launch that never started is the case that
reasoning does not cover -- it changed nothing, so a candidate that has moved
moved under something else, and the refusal's own park is the one that has to
stand.
