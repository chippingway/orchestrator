"""What an oversized candidate no adjudicator could split waits on.

A `single` verdict is the adjudicator saying this change stays one change, and
that is the one answer it may not act on: the ceiling exists so unreviewed
bulk does not reach a pull request, so publishing past it is a human's call.
The workflow says so and stops.

What these cases pin is the shape of that stop. Nothing is published and
nothing is taken back, so the wait costs the issue one comment and no agent:
the commit, the generation, whichever pull request this cycle held or was
measured against, the session, and the recorded verdict are all exactly where
the adjudication left them, and every later tick reads that verdict rather
than paying for a second one. What the sentence it owes may name, and what a
record an older binary left still gets said, are the module beside this one.
