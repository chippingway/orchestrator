"""One closed snapshot owner, and the pass that ends its cycle.

Shared by the modules that ask what a cancellation costs: what the ending
settles and in which order, what the reading its terminal is written on has to
be taken after, and what the correction of a terminal written too early can
leave behind. They drive the real cleanup sweep and the real umbrella walk,
since half of what a closed owner's cases are about is the routing -- a closed
owner reaches its ledger through the sweep and never through the stage handler
its label names.
