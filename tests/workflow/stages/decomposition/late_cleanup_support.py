"""One umbrella made by a split, and what it still owes a remote.

Shared by the three modules that ask about it, because they ask about the same
issue from three ends: what a branch obligation costs the terminal, when the
snapshot it is holding may finally go, and what is left to settle once a human
has closed the owner mid-cycle. Every one of them drives the real handler,
since what is under test is exactly the routing -- an issue that has become an
umbrella never reaches the transaction again, and a closed one is never
dispatched to the stage its label names.

    The defaults are the umbrella the terminal reaches: open, on `umbrella`,
    with a child that ended -- which means closed, because every disposition
    that ends a child closes it as it fires. A case says otherwise when it is
    about a closed owner (swept under either cleanup label) or about a
    consumer a human reopened, which is the state no label records and the one
    the reclamation rule reads.

    `child_ref` is the snapshot the consumer's own ancestry names, which is
    what decides whether this owner may speak for it: a child pointed at a
    sibling generation's ref belongs to that generation. `child_ancestry` is
    False for the crash window the split leaves when it records a child and
    then cannot seed it: the body still carries the marker the create stamped
    into it, and the pinned comment carries nothing.

    `child` is False for the interval BEFORE that: the ref is preserved and
    proved ahead of the first child issue, so an owner closed in there records
    a snapshot and no consumers at all.

    `recorded` is False for the issue that never entered the late gate at all,
    which is every umbrella the initial decomposer ever made: it carries one
    of the two swept labels and no generation, so nothing about a late cycle
    is its to end.

    `cancelled` is the mark either observer leaves -- the flag, the stamp, and
    the boundary it interrupted -- which is what a case about the ending
    starts from rather than reaching through the observer that writes it.

    `announced` is the forward-links receipt the transaction writes in the
    same step as `superseding`, and it is derived from the phase for every
    seed at or past that boundary. A case says it explicitly for the one
    shape where the two disagree: a supersession retried after a park, which
    rewrites the earlier phases over the boundary while stepping over the
    announcement it already made.

    `ancestor_ref` makes this owner somebody else's child as well as its own
    split's owner, which every late owner below the root of a lineage is. It
    is what a case needs to reach the reuse guard that shares the dispatcher's
    one pinned read with the cancellation guard.

    `child_mirror_first` is the ordering claim the split stamps onto every
    pointer it writes -- that the reclamation which can take this ref drops
    this host's copy of it first. False is a pointer written by an
    orchestrator that took the remote first and the mirror afterwards, which
    is what a repository upgraded mid-lineage still carries.

    `phase` defaults to what a finished split leaves, which is what every
    umbrella and every closed owner past its transaction really carries: the
    children are all created and all recorded, so the consumer ledger is the
    whole account of who was cut from the ref. A case about a split still IN
    its loop says `splitting` -- there the list may be short by a child that
    already exists, and nothing on the ref may be reclaimed.
