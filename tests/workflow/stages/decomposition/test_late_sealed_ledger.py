"""The consumer ledger a cancelled split leaves, and what may read it as final.

The count the transaction writes before its first create is what tells a
partial split from a finished one, and a cancelled loop can never reach it:
the children it did not make are ones nothing is going to make. Left at that,
the ref those children were cut from is one no pass could ever release --
every consumer could end and the proof would still be short of the count -- so
the owner would hold a snapshot, and its terminal with it, forever.

What makes the ledger final rather than short is the cancellation itself:
every exit that reaches it with the mark down is one where the child in hand
was already recorded. Except where an EARLIER attempt could have created one
this walk has not reached, which is the one reading no cancellation may seal
over.

And it is a fact about ONE cycle. The seal is a decomposition key, so the
write that clears late mode leaves it exactly where it was, and the cycle an
operator authorizes next comes up against a register a previous one called
final -- which is why the seal names the cycle it belongs to and is read by
nothing else.
