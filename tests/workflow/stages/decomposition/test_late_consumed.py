"""A reply this mode acted on is marked read for every stage, not just this one.

Two readers walk the same issue thread. The late fingerprints stop a comment
coming back as fresh guidance HERE; the shared `last_action_comment_id` stops
the later validating -> in_review handoff finding it as fresh PR feedback and
routing the pull request to `fixing` over an answer already spent. Every route
that reads a reply has to move both, so they are tested together rather than
one at a time beside the semantics each route is really about.
