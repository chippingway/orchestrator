"""The three answers a stranded park notice gets that are not a plain retry.

The retry itself is the module beside this one. What is here is the edges of
it: a park a fresh attempt re-takes, which is announced by that attempt rather
than ahead of it; a sentence too long to write down, which is said once and
honestly not retried; and the guard's own park, whose retry is the owed read
rather than the redelivery -- and which owes the thread nothing to take back
if the thread was never told in the first place.
