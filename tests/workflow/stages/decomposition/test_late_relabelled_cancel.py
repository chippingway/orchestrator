"""Where a cancelled cycle may be dispatched from, which is nowhere labelled.

Every workflow label names a handler that ACTS on the issue rather than
settling it -- one spawns the decomposer, one publishes a candidate, one
resumes a developer -- so a cancelled cycle wearing any of them is refused
whatever it says. A human who relabels such an owner is asking for work on a
cycle a close already ended, and that is the one thing the mark forbids.

Where the TERMINAL lands is a narrower question. The transition graph answers
for every label a workflow wrote: each state a late cycle can be interrupted
on declares the edge to `rejected`, and one that does not is refused and said
out loud rather than relabelled out from under whoever put the issue there.
The two the cycle's own decomposer leaves behind are the exception -- `ready`
and `blocked` are its ordinary outcome, a close observed inside that run lands
ahead of it, and neither label is one anything would ever come back to. The
unlabeled state is the exception in the other direction: it is the restart
handshake itself, and re-applying a terminal there would undo it.
