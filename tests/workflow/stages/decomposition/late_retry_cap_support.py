"""The spent spawn budget a late adjudication stands on, and the thread of it.

The park is seeded rather than earned by running a budget out, because what
these cases are about is the tick that MEETS one: a park is what every later
tick and every restart reads back off the pinned comment, and seeding it is
how an issue says "I arrived already stopped". The one case that earns it
instead is the exhaustion itself, which is about the write and the sentence
that take it.

The issue under it is the late-mode one every neighbouring module uses, so a
generation, a frozen pair, a held pull request, and a recorded run all mean
here exactly what they mean there -- and what a held tick promises to leave
alone is asserted against the record it really arrived with.
