"""The terminal an umbrella earned, finished by whichever pass gets there.

`done` takes the issue off both labels the closed-owner sweep queries, so it
is the one write in this mode that nothing could ever come back to. What makes
it safe is the write AHEAD of it: one pinned write that stamps the resolution
and retires the cycle together, and past which there is no live cycle under
the terminal for anything to have to find.

Everything before that write is ordinary: the owner is on `umbrella` with a
live cycle, which the sweep and the umbrella poll both already own. Everything
after it is a label and a close, asked of a record that already says the
terminal is due -- so a pass that dies in between leaves an owner this sweep
keeps yielding until one of them lands.
