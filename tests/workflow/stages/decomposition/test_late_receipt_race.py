"""The durable half of an observation, and the threads that race it.

A poll that can hand a close to no worker writes the reading down as a marked
comment, because the latch beside it is memory. Asking whether the thread
already carries one and getting one onto it are two operations, and both of
the other parties are inside that gap: the worker running the pass that
settles the reading, and a second poll making the same attempt.

So the attempt is claimed, and the claim carries the GENERATION of the reading
it was taken for. What these cases pin is what each interleaving leaves for
the observation AFTER it -- a memo belongs to one reading, and a close nobody
wrote down is one a restart takes away entirely.
