"""The branch a split superseded, and the change that may come back for it.

The last irreversible act of a published split is the delete that takes its
branch away, and it happens on the umbrella's terminal -- ticks after the pass
that closed the pull request the branch belongs to. A human who reopens that
change has one pointing at a ref this delete would remove out from under them,
and nothing afterwards puts a branch back.

So the question is asked immediately in front of the delete, and not where the
pass assembles its work list. Between those two the snapshot rule may spend a
remote probe of its own, deciding whether an ordered ref the consumers no
longer clear is already gone -- and a probe is a request a human can reopen a
pull request inside. A retry with an owed branch and an ordered ref is exactly
the shape that has one, which is why these cases build one rather than seeding
a fresh umbrella.

And the terminal that closes the parent asks the same question twice more,
off the ledger rather than through it. A reclamation that FINISHED leaves
nothing owed, so an entry-driven guard sees a settled record and waves the
terminal through -- while a human who restored the branch and reopened the
change has left the one thing that still matters unfinished. What the terminal
writes is `done`, a close, and the drop of the publication group, after which
nothing would ever ask again.

Twice, because the settlement's own ask is not the boundary: the resolution
comment and the latches behind it are requests, and the reopen can land in
any of them. So it is asked once where refusing costs nothing -- before
anything is said -- and once immediately in front of the retirement write,
where refusing costs the sentence that has already gone out and the thread is
what stops that repeating.

That receipt belongs to this road and no other. It is scoped to the cycle and
generation, since an operator restarting a rejected one keeps the thread, and
it is stamped only where something behind the sentence could still refuse --
which is nothing on any umbrella but a published split's.
