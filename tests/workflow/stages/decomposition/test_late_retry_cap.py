"""The spent spawn budget a late adjudication parks on, and what lifts it.

Four promises are pinned here. A budget with nothing left in it parks the
issue before any agent starts, and the write that records the park carries
both the late record it stopped on and the sentence it owes the thread. A park
nobody has answered then stops every later tick and every restart where it
stands, keeping the frozen candidate, its held pull request, and the locked
run exactly as they arrived. A trusted `/orchestrator continue` buys one
attempt and no more. And each of those steps is countable on the shared
budget's own audit stream.
