"""What a child's own state does while the walk that releases it runs.

Two races, and the activation walk is the one thing they both end at. The park
between the children and the activation can stand for as long as a human takes
to settle a pull request, so by the time the transaction resumes a child's
state is no longer its to assume -- and the transition guard only warns by
default, so nothing else would stop a write that put a terminal child back to
`ready`.

The other is the parent's own state. A relabel is a request and the poll runs
beside it, so a close observed after the FIRST child was released reaches no
other pass -- and this walk is the one step of a late split that puts an agent
on somebody's repository.
