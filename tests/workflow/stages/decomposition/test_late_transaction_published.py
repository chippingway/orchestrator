"""A split whose candidate was measured on a pull request that already exists.

The transaction closes the pull request this cycle's work is on, hands the
issue to `umbrella`, activates the children, and reclaims the branch. Which
pull request that is depends on the side of publication the generation was
entered on -- the plan one before the first push, the implementation one past
it -- and the second is the sharper of the two: left unsuperseded it is an
open change carrying work nobody will finish, pointing at a branch the
reclamation has already deleted.

So it is proved before it is closed, and the proof is the settlement's own.
A pull request nothing could read, one a human settled while the adjudication
was open, and one somebody pushed to are each a refusal with a durable retry
rather than a supersession taken on evidence that has been overtaken. The
hold this cycle put on that same pull request comes off ahead of all of it,
because a change closed while it still wears a "do not merge" notice wears it
for good.

That the road is entered at all is the first case here and is driven from the
coordinator, since nothing below it would notice a post-publication verdict
that never arrived.

    The write that hands the issue to `umbrella` drops the generation, so the

    of what they can do: the children are left for the umbrella's own walk and
    the branch for its terminal, both of which are retries that already exist
    and both of which take their own reading.

    Which makes the placement the point. The barrier before the retirement is
    the last thing to run before that write, so what is left to these two is
    the window the write itself opens -- and a reopen inside it costs a label
    that lands, not a child that runs or a branch that goes.
