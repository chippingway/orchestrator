"""The settled cancellation a restart is authorized over, and how it is routed.

Every case starts from the same shape -- an issue whose late cycle a close
ended, whose ending owes the remote nothing, and which an operator has
reopened and taken `rejected` off -- so it is built once here. The route is
the dispatcher's own, because the guard under test runs BEFORE a label becomes
a handler call and whether that handler was reached is what a case asserts on.

The pinned comment a case seeds is described here too: one key from every
family a restart drops beside the ones it keeps, so the projection is asserted
against a comment a live issue could really be carrying rather than against
the handful of keys the assertion happens to name.
