"""The ending an owner observed closed earns, and what it may not skip.

A human can close a late-split owner at any point of its reconciliation, so
what these cases pin is the ordering and the idempotence rather than the
reclamation rules -- a branch, a ref, and the consumers a ref is proved
against are settled by the umbrella's own rules and are covered where those
live. What belongs to a cancellation alone: the mark that goes down before any
external call and never moves, the held plan pull request it closes over one
notice, the children it must not touch, and the terminal it may write only
once the remote is holding nothing.
