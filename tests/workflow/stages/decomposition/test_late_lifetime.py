"""How many candidates one issue can have adjudicated before it runs out.

The adjudicator is the one road to an agent that is not a dispatched handler,
so the journeys that walk an issue's whole lifetime cannot drive it and this
is where its half of that coverage lives. What it adds is a loop the other
roads do not have: a developer resumed with guidance commits again, the gate
measures again, and a fresh generation is frozen over the new commit -- which
is an adjudication per candidate, with nothing in the late domain that counts
how many an issue has had.

The lifetime ledger is what counts them, and the second subject here is the
one way an issue gets a fresh domain record without getting fresh runs: an
authorized restart projects a new cycle over the old pinned comment, and the
allowance and the spend are on the list of things it carries across.
