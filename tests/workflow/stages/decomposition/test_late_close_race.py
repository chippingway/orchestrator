"""The close a split transaction has to catch before it has made a child.

A child is the one thing this orchestrator creates that nothing takes back,
and the transaction is not one moment: a push and a fetch stand between the
verdict and the first child, and a create, a record, and a seed stand between
every child and the next. A human can close the issue in any of those gaps,
and a close observed by the poll while this worker holds the issue reaches no
cleanup pass on the tick it happened -- the scheduler admits no second worker
for an issue one is already running. What the run does with what it can see
for itself is this module's subject, one gap at a time.

The gaps PAST the last child -- the announcement, the supersession, and the
retirement -- are the same rule applied to steps with a different consequence,
and they have their own module beside this one.
