"""The owner reads a finished late run is guarded by, described once.

Shared by every module about what one guarded completion becomes: the guard
itself, the park an adjudicator's `single` earns, and the settlement a
decision to publish that candidate unsplit would license. They share the three
answers a fresh read can give -- the issue is open, a human closed it while the
agent ran, and GitHub could not be asked -- because each is a race rather than
a state a fixture can simply seed: the read happens INSIDE the call under test,
after the spawn it is guarding has already returned, so what changes the answer
has to change it from inside the run.

`settle_single` is the settlement's own entry point, for the cases about the
road rather than about the reply that reaches it. It stands beside the runs
because it needs the same worktree seams they do.

The three finished runs are module constants because `AgentResult` is frozen
and every one of these tests wants the same one: what differs between them is
what the world does while the run is in flight, not what the run said.

The plan-PR case sits here for the same reason it does in the hold's own
tests: an issue that reached its implementation through a design discussion is
the only one with a description to put back, and several of these modules ask
about it.
