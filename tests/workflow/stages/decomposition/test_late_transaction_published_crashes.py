"""What a split entered past publication leaves between an effect and its record.

The same seams the plan-PR road is killed at, asked of the road that closes
the implementation pull request the work is already on -- because that road
reaches them carrying something the other never does. The pull request exists
before the transaction starts, its branch is the one the reclamation takes
down, and the supersession that closes it is proved rather than searched for.
So a crash in front of the children, between the notice and the close, or
between the close and the branch behind it leaves a different world here, and
each case runs the transaction again from what the pinned comment holds --
exactly what the next eligible tick does, since the verdict is already
recorded and the retry costs a read rather than an agent.
