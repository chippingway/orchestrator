"""What a reopened owner may reach while its cancelled cycle is unfinished.

Cancellation is irreversible within its cycle, so a human who reopens the
issue does not get that cycle back. Both labels an adjudication can be wearing
name a handler that ACTS on the issue rather than settling it: one spawns the
decomposer, the other walks the dependency graph and activates children. So
what is pinned here is the one place a label becomes a handler call, driven
through the real dispatcher, on both of those labels -- and the ending the
reopen has to pass through before anything works the issue again, which is the
same `rejected` an operator removes to authorize a restart.
