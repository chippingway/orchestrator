"""A poll latching a close from inside one of the run's own requests.

The latch is what the run in flight asks before every step the remote keeps,
and every case that needs one asks it against a window that is REMOTE work:
the pinned write that forces an issue to be an umbrella, the repository walk
that looks a half-created child up, the child-label scan an umbrella opens
with, the request that opens a child issue, the branch delete a terminal
settles with, the relabel that releases the first child. A human closes the
issue inside one of those, a poll sees it, and no second worker may be handed
the reading -- which is exactly the shape these seams plant.
