"""The close a process that is gone observed, and this one has to finish.

A latch is memory. It covers every observation the process holding it makes --
the run in flight asks it before every step the remote keeps -- and it covers
nothing at all once that process dies. So the poll that latches a close also
writes it down, as a marked comment on the issue thread: append-only, which is
the whole reason it is a comment rather than a pinned write, since the pinned
comment is written whole and a second writer racing the worker that owns the
issue would drop whatever that worker recorded in between.

What the tick after a restart therefore finds is an issue a human reopened, a
record still saying the cycle is live, nothing in memory -- and a thread that
remembers. Adopting that receipt is the whole of this module, along with the
two things that keep the adoption from costing more than it is worth: it is
scoped to the cycle it was written for, and the thread is walked once per
owner per process.
