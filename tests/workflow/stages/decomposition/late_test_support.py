"""The one oversized candidate the late-mode tests adjudicate.

One frozen generation described once, so the hold, the prompt, the reply
parser, the pinned run record, and the coordinator over them all read the same
candidate: a field added to the record is exercised by every one of them
without five copies of the fixture drifting apart. The harness those tests run
a coordinator inside is the module beside this one.

The pinned keys are gathered on one record rather than spelled loose, because
they are the compatibility contract the late run round-trips through: a test
naming one of them is naming the durable key a live issue would carry.
