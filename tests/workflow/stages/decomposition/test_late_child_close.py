"""The close a split has to catch between the steps that make a child.

A child is the one thing this orchestrator creates that nothing takes back,
and making one is not a moment: the write that forces the parent to be an
umbrella stands ahead of the first, the walk that looks a half-created slice
up stands ahead of the create, and the read of the child's own comment stands
ahead of the one write this transaction makes to it. Every one of those is a
request the poll runs beside.

So the latch is asked at each of them, and what it earns is two different
answers. Before the create: no issue is opened at all. After it: the issue
exists, the parent RECORDS it -- a child nothing names is the one state no
pass can clean up -- and nothing is written to the child itself, because a
cancelled cycle leaves every child it already made entirely untouched.

Every case here runs against an issue GitHub reports OPEN, which is what makes
the latch the only thing that knows.
