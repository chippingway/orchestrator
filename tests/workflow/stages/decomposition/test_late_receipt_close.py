"""The receipts a reclaimed ref owes, delivered one child at a time.

Every child cut from a snapshot is told once that the ref is gone, and each
telling is a comment on somebody ELSE's issue. So the walk is not one moment:
a close observed after the first receipt is one the second may not be written
over, because a cancelled cycle owes its children nothing at all -- it does
not close them, relabel them, write their pinned state, or put a word on their
threads.

The mark therefore goes down between the two, and the walk stops telling the
children after it. It still answers "all told", because a cycle that owes no
receipt has left none undelivered.
