"""The close a reclamation has to catch between the obligations it settles.

A settled split owes a remote two things -- the branch its candidate sat on
and the immutable ref its children were cut from -- and it settles them one
request at a time, with a fresh consumer proof standing between the decision
and the ref delete it authorizes. Every one of those is a window the poll runs
beside.

The receipts each delivered ref owes are `test_late_receipt_close`'s, beside
this. What the mark changes here is not WHETHER the rest is settled: a
cancellation buys no shortcut through the reclamation rules, and the ref goes only because every
recorded consumer is proved ended, exactly as it would have. What it changes
is what the settling owes anybody -- a cancelled cycle tells its consumers
nothing -- and whether the reclamation can be attributed to it at all, which
is why the mark has to be DOWN before the ref is gone rather than after.
