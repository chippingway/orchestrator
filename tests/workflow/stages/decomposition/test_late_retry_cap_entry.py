"""The spent-budget park a late tick meets with its sentence still unsaid.

Two owners can have taken a `retry_cap` park under `workflow:decomposing`, and
they record what it owes the thread on different fields. The late adjudication
writes `late_park_notice` and says it from inside its own tick; the shared
parking form writes `retry_cap_notice`, and the only thing that says that one
is the replay at stage entry -- which stands down, saying nothing, for exactly
one reason: a thread it could not read.

The late hold runs the very next step. So the tick is driven through the stage
handler rather than through the coordinator, because the whole subject is what
the second step does about the first step's silence: a second read taken there
is as likely to succeed as the first was to fail, and a park read as explained
would buy an adjudication with a command written before the human was ever
asked anything.
