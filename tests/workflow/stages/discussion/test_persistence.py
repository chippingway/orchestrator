"""When the round's records reach GitHub, and what happens when they never do.

The spec and the session id are staged on the `PinnedState` the tick read at
the top and are made durable by one write, the same contract every spawning
stage keeps, plus the anchor and the spec that are written before it. Four
things follow and are pinned here: a round costs one write on each side of the
spawn, the park's write lands after the comment it records, the spec is the
full configured command string and is already there when the agent is invoked
rather than after it succeeds, and a round that dies before its disposition
leaves that provenance behind -- which is what lets the next tick classify the
commit it may have made instead of adopting it.

The spec case is the one with two ways to be wrong that a default-config test
cannot see. A bare `claude` reads the same whether the stage stored the spec or
just the backend, and a run that hands back a session id reaches the same
pinned state whether the spec was staged before the spawn or after it -- so the
case here configures args and takes a session id away.
