"""The four ways an opening round ends somewhere other than a design.

A timeout and a silent exit are the agent failing to say anything; commits and
a dirty tree are it saying something by doing. The one write this stage allows
is the agreed plan on its own path, so a round that committed anything else --
or left edits loose beside it -- publishes nothing, and an opening round has by
definition no confirmation behind it yet. All four park awaiting a human with
their own reason, so an operator reading pinned state can tell which happened,
and all four keep the worktree, because in every one of them there is something
on disk worth looking at. What a commit that IS the plan earns instead is in
`test_publication.py`.
