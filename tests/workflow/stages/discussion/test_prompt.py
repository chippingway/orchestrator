"""The contract each discussion prompt makes with its agent.

Each clause here is one the stage would be pointless without: an agent that
asks a human for facts `git log` answers burns a round, one that returns a
single answer instead of a tree hides the decision, one that asks about naming
crowds out the architecture, one that asks everything at once asks for
decisions its own earlier answers may moot, and one that starts implementing
has taken the confirmation this stage exists to wait for.

The resume prompt is held to the same contract plus the one clause only it can
break. A round that read the humans' answers as agreement and stopped there
would end the conversation without advancing it, so what it is asked for is
the tree redrawn around what those answers settled and the frontier they
opened up -- and the no-write rule is restated, since an answered design
question is the moment an agent is likeliest to decide it may now build.

Both carry the plan clause, and both are checked for it. The confirmation can
land on either -- an opening prompt is also what a round with no session to
resume is given, however many rounds in that happens -- and the clause has to
name the same single path, the same "nothing else", and the same "do not push"
that the publication check enforces, or a plan written to the letter of the
prompt is refused by the orchestrator that asked for it.
