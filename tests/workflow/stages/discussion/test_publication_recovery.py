"""What a publication that did not finish costs, which is a tick and no more.

A plan commit can outlive the round that made it -- a mid-run pause withholds
every disposition by contract, a crash takes them with it -- and it can outlive
the publication itself, when a tick dies between opening the PR and recording
it or when the push simply fails. Each of those leaves the same thing on disk:
a branch whose whole diff against base is the plan file. So each is answered
the same way, by publishing it, and the parts that make that safe to repeat are
what this module pins.

Repeating it is safe because the records bracket the PR: the marker names the
tip before anything can change the world, and the rest land after it, so the
window a crash falls into leaves a PR the next tick adopts (`test_publication_
reuse.py`) rather than a record naming one that was never opened. The
alternative to all of this is what the refusal parks would otherwise say to an
operator: reset the worktree, discarding a plan the humans agreed to and a PR
that may already be open against it.

What none of it extends to is a commit nobody here began: while a marker
stands, it answers for the branch, so a second plan-shaped commit appearing
over an unfinished publication parks rather than going out as the agreed
design.
