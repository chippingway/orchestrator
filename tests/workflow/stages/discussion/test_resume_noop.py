"""The ticks on a parked discussion that have to leave everything as it was.

Four things can reach a parked issue without being an answer to it: nobody
having replied, a reply from an author the allowlist does not cover, a round
the shutdown sweep killed before it could answer, and a reply arriving into a
checkout an operator was parked to repair. Each has to end with the durable
record untouched -- because that record is what the next tick reads to find
the answer still waiting.

Every case is asserted against the pinned state rather than only against the
absent spawn. A tick that consumed a reply it never acted on is indisting-
uishable from a correct one until the next tick, by which time the human's
answer is simply gone and only another comment from them will restart it.
