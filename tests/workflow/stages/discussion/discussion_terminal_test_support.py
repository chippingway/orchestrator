"""Fixtures for the tick that finds a discussion over rather than running one.

The seeds here are the two shapes that tick can arrive in: an issue whose plan
its publication already put on a pull request, and one a human closed with no
plan on a pull request at all. Both records the publication writes are seeded
together, because the stage reads them as a pair -- a `pr_number` alone is one
an issue relabeled here from a PR stage arrived carrying.

`_TerminalRun` carries the client and the issue so the readings a terminal is
judged by -- what was written, what was posted, what was emitted -- are asked
of one object rather than reassembled in every test.

`_TerminalTick` exists for the teardown alone. The hermetic patch set installs
its own neutral `_cleanup_terminal_branch`, so a test whose subject IS the
teardown has to land its mock INSIDE the tick, where it is the one the terminal
resolves rather than the one that was replaced.
