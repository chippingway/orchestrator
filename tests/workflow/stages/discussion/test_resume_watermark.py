"""What a discussion round records as read, and what it deliberately does not.

A round reads the thread once, at the top, and then spends minutes inside an
agent run. Everything that lands in that window -- a human's second thought, a
comment from an author the allowlist does not yet cover -- was never in front
of the agent, and this stage reads no comment twice: recorded as consumed, it
would be answered never. So the ceiling the park leaves is the newest comment
the round's own prompt was built from, not the newest comment on the thread.

That leaves the stage's own analysis sitting above its own watermark, which is
the trade this makes deliberately. It is safe for the reason the in_review and
validating scans rely on: an orchestrator-posted comment is recognized by the
id recorded when it was posted and by the marker in its body, never by author
login -- which on a PAT shared with a human's account would swallow that
human's replies as bot noise.
