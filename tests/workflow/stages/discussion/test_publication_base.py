"""The commit a publication measures the branch against.

A round is judged by what its branch changes against the base branch, so the
base is half of that judgement and the half the agent is closest to: the
per-issue checkout is a linked worktree sharing the clone's refs, so
`refs/remotes/<remote>/<base>` is a name the round itself can repoint. An agent
that commits code, moves that ref onto the code commit, and then commits the
plan leaves a ref-relative diff naming one path and a branch carrying two
commits -- and the push publishes both.

What closes it is an object id read from the remote before the agent is
spawned, recorded on the issue, and named to the diff. Recorded rather than
re-read, because the tick that publishes need not be the tick that ran: a
recovery has to measure against the base its round was given, and a fresh read
would put the local ref back in the answer.
