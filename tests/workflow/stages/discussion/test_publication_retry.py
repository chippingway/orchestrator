"""The retries a publication waits for, and what a crash inside one costs.

A push that failed is the one unfinished publication this stage does not resume
on its own: the park is a request to an operator, and pushing at a remote that
is refusing us on every poll would comment each time it did. The reply to that
park is the retry, and it is also the operator saying why it would work now.

Which makes the retry's own first write the delicate one. It spends that reply --
a retry must not be asked for twice by the same comment -- so whatever it leaves
behind has to be a publication something will pick up again. Leaving the failure
reason standing through it satisfies neither reader: the recovery path refuses to
resume that reason, and the parked path finds nothing unread to resume it with.

The other retry is the one nobody has to ask for. A lookup GitHub declines is
not a request to a human -- one read has to be taken again, and the next poll
takes it -- so the publication holds silently. That hold still has to WRITE,
and it is the only reason it writes anything at all: the marker is what
persists what a fresh round staged, and the session id is in there.
