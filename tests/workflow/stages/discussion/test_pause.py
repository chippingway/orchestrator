"""The rounds that finish and are then declined, and what the next tick makes
of what they left.

An operator who applies `paused` (or `backlog`) while the round is in flight,
and a shutdown sweep that kills it, reach the same requirement from different
directions: whatever the round produced must not be posted, parked, or written,
and the durable state has to stay exactly as the previous tick left it so the
next active tick opens the same first round again. Both are read after the
spawn returns -- the pause off a freshly fetched issue, since the handler's own
snapshot predates the label.

What a declined round does leave is the anchor its spawn wrote: the SHA the
checkout was on when it opened. That is not a disposition, it is the record
that makes one possible later -- without it the next tick would reuse the same
checkout and read a commit the declined round made as work the branch arrived
carrying.
