"""A publication whose checkout and local branch are both gone.

The marker is written before the push and the PR number only after the PR is
open, so the widest crash window leaves an issue whose plan is on the remote
and whose PR is up, with nothing pinned pointing at either. Everything the next
tick needs is still recorded -- the marker names the commit, the anchor names
the branch -- but none of it is on this host any more once the worktree
directory and the local ref go with a restart, an operator's cleanup, or a
fresh clone.

What decides the outcome is where the checkout is rebuilt from. Anchored on
`<remote>/<base>` the branch comes back without the published commit, and the
publication is then refused for a tip it cannot find while the PR it opened
stays up unretired and the conversation is free to open another round over the
top of it. Anchored on `<remote>/<branch>` the pushed commit comes back with
it, and the tick finishes the publication it began.

`pr_number` cannot be what that choice is made on, because the crash this is
about is the one that happens before `pr_number` exists. The marker is, and the
remote is what says whether the push it precedes ever landed.

A push that REPORTED failure reaches the same state by the other door, and it
is the door nothing resumes on its own: that park is a request to an operator,
so the reply answering it is the only thing that ever carries the marker
forward. "The push failed" is a claim about the request rather than about the
remote, and by the time the reply arrives this host can have lost the checkout
and the ref along with it -- at which point every local reading says nothing
ever happened.
