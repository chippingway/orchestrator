"""A reply into a checkout that went wrong after the round that asked for it.

The parks that report a read-only violation also say how to undo it, so a
reply arriving while one of those is standing needs nothing more said. A park
that ended cleanly says none of that -- and the tree can still be dirtied or
committed to afterwards, by an operator mid-inspection or by whatever else
shares the host. Answering the frontier then gets silence: no round may open on
that tree, and nothing on the thread explains why.

So the first reply into it is reported, once, with the paths and the command.
The reason that park lands under is itself one the guard recognizes, which is
what makes the report idempotent -- the next reply into the same tree is held
quietly. And no path here consumes the reply, so repairing the tree is the
whole of what an operator has to do: the answer they already wrote is picked up
on the tick after.
