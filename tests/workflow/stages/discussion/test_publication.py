"""The one thing this stage publishes, and everything it refuses to.

Publication is decided by the artifact rather than by the conversation: the
orchestrator cannot check that a human confirmed anything, so what it checks is
that the branch is the plan file and nothing besides. That makes the refusals
the load-bearing half -- a missing plan, a second one, a code change riding
along, or edits left loose beside the commit -- and each of them has to end
with the branch unpushed, nothing recorded, and the worktree exactly as the
round left it.

What a valid artifact earns is the plan on a PR and the conversation over. The
records that publication leaves are the handoff: the plan path and PR number
the gate reads to stop opening rounds, the branch a later checkout is restored
from, and the anchor moved onto the published tip so the relabel that has this
built is not refused for the commit this stage just published. The crash
windows around all of that are pinned beside this in
`test_publication_recovery.py`.
