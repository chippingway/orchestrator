"""The round a first `discussion` tick opens, and the turn it hands back.

One tick on a freshly labeled issue runs the configured decomposer once in the
issue's own worktree, posts what it wrote to the thread, and parks awaiting a
human -- and stops there: no developer, no reviewer, no PR, and no teardown of
the tree the next round reads. The tick after that one is the humans' turn, so
a parked issue earns nothing at all until they answer.
