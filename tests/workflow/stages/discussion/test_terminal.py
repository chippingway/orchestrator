"""What ends a discussion, and what it keeps until one of them does.

Every module beside this one covers a conversation still running. This one
covers the tick that finds it over: the plan PR the humans merged or turned
down, the plan PR they have not decided about yet, and the issue somebody
closed with no plan on a pull request at all.

The two halves of that are asserted together throughout, because each is only
right given the other. A terminal has to record itself -- the stamp, the label,
the receipt, the event, the close -- and only then reap the checkout and the
branches; a hold has to record nothing at all and reap nothing, since what the
worktree carries is what the open pull request is open against.
