"""The repositories the discussion stage's object-level tests are run against.

Two of this stage's checks are only as good as the object store behind them:
the base a round pins is spent on a local diff, and the ancestry a publication
judges a remote head by is a local command over local objects. Both take an id
the REMOTE named, so what they are really about is the gap between an id and
the commit it stands for -- and a mock can only show that a fetch was asked
for. So those tests build real repositories: an upstream standing in for
GitHub, a clone of it, and a linked worktree sharing its store.

The two token-bearing calls are what connect them. `_remote_branch_tip` and
`_authed_target_fetch` are the only places this stage reaches the network, so
each test redirects them at the upstream over a path and everything they hand
back is real -- real objects, a real refspec, a real store the worktree reads
from.

The base branch and slug are spelled here rather than taken from the hermetic
fixtures, because these modules build their own world: what has to agree is the
branch the upstream carries and the branch the spec names, and nothing here
depends on the values every mocked tick is seeded with.
