"""Fixtures the discussion-stage tests share.

The stage's whole contract is "discuss and wait", so the two assertions every
module below repeats are that nothing was published (no push, no PR, no
relabel) and that the worktree the round ran in is still on disk for the next
round and the operator to read.

`_run_discussion` seeds a HEAD that does not move across the round, because a
round is only read as having committed when the SHA it opened on changes under
it. A test about commits says so by overriding `head_shas`.
