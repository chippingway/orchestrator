"""Fixtures for a discussion the humans have already been asked something.

A parked issue is seeded rather than produced by running its first round,
because what a resume turns on is the durable record a park leaves: the pinned
agent, the session, the anchor, and the thread position the next round's
replies are read after. Seeding those directly is what lets one test name one
of them as its variable -- an absent session id, a flipped pin -- without
arranging a whole first round to produce it.

`_DiscussionConversation` is the opposite fixture, for the assertions that only
a running conversation can carry: what accumulates across rounds, and whether
the tree survives them. It drives real ticks end to end for that reason, and
numbers each reply past the watermark the round before it left, so a stage
resuming on its own posted analysis would be visible rather than silently
correct.
