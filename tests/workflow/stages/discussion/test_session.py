"""What keeps a later discussion round on the agent that opened the first.

A round can end with no disposition -- a mid-run pause withholds every one by
contract, a crash takes them with it -- and the next tick opens it again; a
human answering the frontier opens one deliberately. The configured
`DECOMPOSE_AGENT` can change between any two of those ticks, so the spec
pinned at the first spawn is read back rather than re-resolved: a round that
followed the new config would move the conversation onto a backend and argument
set that never ran on this issue, and then overwrite the pin with them. A
resume has one more thing to lose by it -- the session id is only meaningful
to the CLI that issued it, so the flipped backend would be handed a
conversation it has never heard of.
