"""A plan PR head a human moved past the plan, judged over real objects.

The recovery that adopts such a pull request turns on one question: does the
head the remote is on still CONTAIN the commit this publication pushed? It is
asked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, a local command over local objects,
and the id it is asked about is the remote's own answer about a branch this
host has not fetched since. The human's commit was made after the checkout
was, so a worktree a crash left behind has never seen it, git refuses an id it
cannot resolve, and that refusal is indistinguishable from a branch somebody
reset out from under the plan: the publication parks `discussion_push_failed`,
the reply that retries it reaches the same unfetched id, and the plan stays
published, reviewable, and unreachable from the issue that produced it.

Real repositories rather than mocked git for that reason -- an ancestry result
handed in answers for the very thing under test -- and each case proves the
trap first on the same world: before the tick runs, the amended head is neither
present here nor answerable as an ancestor.

The other half is what a head the fetch does not deliver does. Adopting a pull
request on a reading nobody could take would record it against an ancestry
never established, so an unresolvable head is left to the lease, which refuses
the push and says what is on the branch while the plan commit stays put.

The world is built by the real-git support module beside this one, and the
stage's own fixtures are reached through their module rather than name by name,
since what these two tests need from them is most of the vocabulary.
