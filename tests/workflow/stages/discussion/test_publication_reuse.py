"""Adopting a pull request that is already open on the branch.

A publication asks for the open PR before it opens one, which is what turns a
tick that died between `open_pr` and its records into a reuse rather than a
duplicate. What comes back, though, is only known to be open on this branch:
an issue can arrive here carrying a PR, and an operator can open one by hand.
So the reuse fixes up what it adopts -- the body has to name the session whose
plan the branch now carries, since that name is how a reviewer finds the
conversation the plan came out of, and a body about something else would
describe the published plan as whatever that PR used to be.

Presence of the name is the whole test, not equality with what this stage
would write: a PR of ours that a human has since annotated still says who
produced it, and rewriting it wholesale would throw their words away.

The same crash window has a longer half, and open state cannot answer it. A
human can merge the plan PR before anything comes looking, which closes it and
-- with the repository auto-deleting merged branches -- takes its head branch
away too. Searched by open state alone the recovery finds nothing, so it pushes
the branch back into existence and asks GitHub for a second pull request on a
commit that is already in the base. What finds it instead is the commit the
marker names, asked of any state.

What is DONE with that answer covers a close without a merge as well, because
to a publication both are the same thing: a verdict the humans have given, and
nothing left to push at. Read as nothing, a closed one would be answered with a
REPLACEMENT pull request proposing the design they just turned down. Recorded
instead, it is what the terminal finishes the issue `rejected` from -- so
neither ending is parked with the "review the plan there" message an open one
earns, since telling somebody to review what they have already decided is
answering a verdict with instructions.

What the search matches on is the commits a pull request CARRIES rather than
the head it is on. The window it exists for is the one between opening the PR
and recording its number, and a human pushing to that branch -- or merging the
base into it to make it mergeable -- moves the head inside that window while
the published commit stays in the pull request.
