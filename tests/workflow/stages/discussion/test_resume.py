"""What a human's answer to a parked round is handed to, and how far it moves.

A park is the humans' turn, so the only thing that ends it is one of them
answering. What that answer then reaches is the round that asked the question
-- the pinned session, fed the reply and told to redraw the tree around it --
because a fresh agent would re-open a design the thread has already narrowed.

The two ways that can go wrong have their own cases here. An untrusted author
may neither steer the agent nor be recorded as read, and the ceiling the
consume stops at is asked of the owner rather than through a tick, since the
park that follows stamps the watermark at the newest comment on the thread
whatever the consume staged. And a round with no session id to resume has
nothing cached at all, so it is given the whole conversation rebuilt rather
than a quote that would arrive with no design attached to it.

The ticks that must leave the park untouched are in `test_resume_noop.py`.
