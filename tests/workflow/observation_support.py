"""The close a poll observed, put where the tests of two packages can set it.

A poll that finds a late-split owner closed while a worker holds it latches
that reading process-wide and leaves a marked receipt on the issue thread. The
latch is what the run in flight asks before every step the remote keeps; the
receipt is what the process after a restart has instead of it.

All of it is process state -- the latch, the memo saying the receipt landed,
the generation that memo is counted against, the claim a poll posts one under,
the claim on the one thread walk a process owes each owner, and the cycle a
worker is retiring off a record right now -- so every case that touches any of
them replaces all six first. That is also how a RESTART
is written: fresh registries beside a thread that still carries the receipt are
exactly what a new process wakes up to.

Here rather than beside either caller because the dispatcher's own tests set
these and the decomposition stage's tests read them, and a second copy of the
fixture would drift from whichever of the two it was not written for.
