"""The late generation the domain's tests read state and events off.

One frozen candidate described once: the state round trip writes it, the
record builder correlates against it, and the dual emission carries it to both
sinks, so a field added to the record is exercised by all three without three
copies of the same fixture drifting apart. `family_cases` is the same idea for
the seven event families -- one valid event per family, built where the
family schema is spelled, so a test that walks them all cannot fall behind a
family the schema gained.
