"""The late generation the domain's tests read state and events off.

One frozen candidate described once: the state round trip writes it, the
record builder correlates against it, and the dual emission carries it to both
sinks, so a field added to the record is exercised by all three without three
copies of the same fixture drifting apart. `family_cases` is the same idea for
the event families whose record reads over that generation -- one valid event
per family, built where the family schema is spelled. The transfer sits beside
them in `transfer_event` rather than among them, because its record is only
ever written past a publication and a generation entered before one could not
carry it; `every_family` is the two together, so a walk over the vocabulary
cannot fall behind a family the schema gained.
