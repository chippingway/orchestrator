The default world is the ordinary one -- a commit this host holds, a base the
remote named, a diff well under any ceiling, and a contribution that
fingerprints -- so a test about publishing says nothing about either reading
and a test about one of them seeds exactly what it is about.

    two commits it was asked about, and anything written from it carries them.

    A `FingerprintFailure` seed is a reading that did not happen and carries
    no digest at all, because a digest over the empty stdout a failed `git
    diff` writes is one every broken reading in the fleet would agree on.

    A mapping keyed on the CANDIDATE is what a rewrite needs, since the whole
    question a transfer turns on is whether two commits contribute the same
    thing: a case about a replay that moved content seeds the rewritten end
    apart and leaves the accepted one where the adjudication recorded it.

    Built from the seed alone rather than from a run context, since both

    adjudication's own -- seed it the same way.
