"""The close the REFETCH is the first thing to see.

An issue open when the enumeration listed it carries no reading at all: the
poll latched nothing and wrote nothing down, because there was nothing to
latch. The refetch every pass takes on its way to a handler can be where that
stops being true -- a human closes the issue in between -- and from there the
reading exists in exactly one place, the object the refetch just returned.

Everything behind it can fail. The pinned read the guard is built on answers a
refusal of its own, and the write that marks the cancellation is a request
like any other; a pass that dies on either leaves nothing saying a close was
ever seen, and a human who reopens the issue before the next poll takes the
reading off the remote for good. So the observation is taken where it is first
established, by both paths that refetch: the sequential loop, which has no
hand-off to hold one for it, and the worker, which has one carrying the poll's
older reading instead.
