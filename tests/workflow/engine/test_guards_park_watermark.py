"""How far a park records the thread as read, and why it is that far.

A park posts its notice and then writes the watermark, and those are two
operations. What goes down is the id of the comment this call POSTED rather
than whatever the thread ends on afterwards -- on a park whose whole point is
waiting for a reply, reading the tip would throw away the answer with the
question.
