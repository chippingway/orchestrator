"""One closed owner whose cleanup ran and left the ending owed.

The deferral cases next door are about a pass nothing could hand the reading
to, or one that broke before it marked anything. These are about the pass that
looks most finished and is not: it ran every step of the ending and the remote
would not let it complete one -- a delete refused, a terminal declined -- so
the observation it was carrying is still the only thing that routes the owner
back, and the label it was reached under may not be there any more.
