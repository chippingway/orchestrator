"""The thread and the ledger the add-agent-runs command is read against.

The park's own fixtures live beside its owner
(`run_limit_test_support`); what is here is the half this command adds to
them -- an issue that has actually spent what it was allowed, the comment
somebody wrote on its thread, and the counts that buy runs beside the ones
that buy none. Three suites read them: the grammar that turns a line into a
request, the owner that spends on one, and the dispatcher's, since the command
is answered by the hold rather than by a stage.
