"""What a comment has to say before anything reads it as a request for runs.

The reading is pinned apart from the spending it pays for, because it is the
whole of what stands between a line somebody typed and agent time: a line of
its own, an exact whole count inside the bound, and the last such line in the
batch. Everything else buys nothing, and buys the same nothing however it
fails.
