"""What a settlement postponed by a hold may not take with it when it lands.

A settle arriving while a worker holds the issue is recorded rather than
taken, and the recorded one is discharged as the last hold goes. The two are
one critical section, and this is why: between them this owner would be
holding neither a hold nor the reading, and a poll is another thread.

So a close latched in that gap is a reading the discharged settlement would
erase -- along with the memo saying its receipt is already on the thread, and
with the generation moved twice for a single settlement, which is exactly how
a thread that already carries a receipt earns a second one. All of it for a
reading that belongs to the NEXT observation rather than the one being
discharged.

Driven by a lock that lets the race in at the first release it sees, because
that is the seam: one acquisition means the poll arrives after the settlement,
and two mean it arrives between them.
