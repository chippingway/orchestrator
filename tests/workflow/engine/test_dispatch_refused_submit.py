"""What a fan-out submit refused for a CLOSED issue was carrying.

The scheduler admits no second worker for an issue one is already running,
and a refusal costs a turn -- except where the submission carried an
OBSERVATION. The cleanup route says so from the label; the window this module
is about says so from nowhere at all.

A `single` verdict hands its issue to `workflow:implementing` a moment before
it retires the cycle, so a close landing there wears a label whose handler is
an ordinary terminal. Nothing about the route says a late cycle is standing
under it, so the reading is established from the RECORD instead -- a read this
path can afford, since it runs only when a worker is already holding the
issue.
