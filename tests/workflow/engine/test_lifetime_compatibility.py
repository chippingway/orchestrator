"""What the lifetime ledger has to leave exactly as it found it.

A ceiling on agent runs arrives on issues that are already running, under
counters that already exist, in front of caps that already refuse work. Each
case here is one of those: an issue whose only meter is the legacy one, an
ending that has to report what the whole issue cost, and a stage cap that has
always fired before anything spawns. None of them is about the ledger
deciding something -- they are about it deciding nothing it was not asked to.
