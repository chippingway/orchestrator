"""What one add-agent-runs request moves, and what it leaves exactly alone.

The grammar a line has to satisfy before it is a request at all is pinned
beside its own owner (`test_run_grant_request`); what is pinned here is what
happens to an issue once one arrives. A request buys runs only while this park
stands and only on a trusted author's word. Everything else leaves the ledger
where it found it -- the allowance and the runs spent against it both -- and
says so once, or says nothing at all where saying something would be answering
an outsider.

A grant is pinned as an absolute ceiling rather than an increment, because
that is what makes it safe to hand out before the write that records it: read
twice, the same command buys the same runs.
