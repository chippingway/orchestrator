"""Direct coverage of the two entry points that fetch a PR of their own.

`_finalize_if_pr_merged` is the single-ending one the umbrella / blocked
aggregation asks: the no-`pr_number` / open-PR / closed-without-merge negative
cases, the merged-PR finalize on an open vs. already-closed issue, and the
terminal usage-verdict receipt it posts (tracked before the pinned-state
write). `_pr_terminal_stops_the_tick` is what the stages carrying no PR-state
arc of their own ask instead, and it decides BOTH endings off ONE reading --
which is the thing worth pinning, since two fetches would be two moments."""
