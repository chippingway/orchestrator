"""How the shared agent-run budget stream is read back off both of its sinks.

Three owners write to it -- the circuit that charges a launch, the park a
spent lifetime takes, and the command that widens one -- so the fixtures a
case reads it with sit apart from all three. What every one of them needs is
the same two things: the records a sink was handed, and the phases in them.

The analytics half needs a patch and the audit half does not. That sink is
disabled unless a path is configured, which is every test's default, so a case
that has to see what it was handed installs the capture below; a case that
only has to count transitions reads the audit copy, which the fake client
keeps for free.
