"""One closed snapshot owner, driven through whole polling ticks.

The subject is a race between two threads and two ticks, so nothing here is
called directly: a case seeds the owner, says which ticks a worker holds it
for, and reads what the ticks left. Everything below the tick is real -- the
partition, the scheduler, the route, and the sweep the route reaches.
