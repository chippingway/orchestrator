"""A close the POLL observed while a worker was publishing.

The latch is what the barriers standing immediately before a push read, and
what puts a reading in it is the enumeration: a poll that finds an issue closed
latches it, writes the durable half down, and drops it again where the record
says there is nothing to end. That last rule was written for the late-split
protocol, where "nothing to end" means no live cycle -- and it is exactly what
every publication a barrier guards looks like. A first push has no generation
yet; an approved or recovered one retires its own before pushing.

So the two threads meet: the poll drops the reading, the worker asks the latch
a moment later and is told nothing was seen, and the push it should have
refused goes out onto an issue a human closed. What holds them apart is the
window the dispatch advertises around itself -- inside it the drop is
postponed, and taken again on the way out.

Two production calls put a reading there and drop it again -- the enumeration
that first reads the issue closed, and the refused fan-out submit that holds
what the poll was carrying when the scheduler turned it away because a worker
already had the issue. Both are driven here rather than a latch planted, so
what these pin is the behaviour a poll actually has.

WHEN the hold starts is the other half, and the refused submit is what makes
it matter: that refusal happens because a worker has the issue, and the worker
has it from the moment the scheduler admits the submit -- not from whenever it
gets around to reading something. The queue, the refetch and the label checks
all sit in between, and a reading dropped in there is one no barrier ever sees.
