"""Every stage road that spawns an agent stops at a spent lifetime ledger.

The charge is taken at one boundary, but what makes it worth anything is that
each road actually goes through that boundary with the issue it is spending.
So these cases drive the real handlers rather than the boundary: a stage wired
to spawn without naming its budget is one that would run an agent here, and no
assertion about the circuit alone would notice.

What is asserted is the same on every road: no process is invoked, the issue
is durably parked on `agent_run_limit` with the sentence that explains it, and
the spend is exactly what the ledger already carried -- a refusal charges
nothing, because nothing ran.

Every road is driven twice, over a clean checkout and over one that is not.
The second world is the one that matters: several roads read the worktree
BEFORE they ask whether the run happened, on purpose -- what a killed run left
on disk is an operator's to see -- and a launch that never started would
otherwise be blamed for whatever an earlier one left there, replacing the park
the refusal had just recorded with a reason about a process that never existed.

The late adjudicator is the one spawning road not driven from here: it is not
a dispatched handler and runs inside a harness of its own, so its case lives
beside it in `tests/workflow/stages/decomposition/test_late_run_limit.py`.
