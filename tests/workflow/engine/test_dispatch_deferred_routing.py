"""What a held close observation outranks when the next tick sorts its issues.

An observation is not a reading the current tick took. It came from a poll
that found the issue closed and could hand that to nobody, so everything this
tick can see about the issue has been overtaken: a human may have reopened it,
parked it with `backlog` / `paused`, or moved its label off the two the closed
sweep queries. Each of those would otherwise take the reading away for good --
the park drops the issue before the partition even sees it, and the relabel
means the enumeration never yields it at all.

So the observation decides the route by NUMBER, ahead of every filter above
the builder. What the sweep does with the issue it reaches is the same either
way: mark the cancellation an observed close already earned, and defer every
external step to a pass that can trust its own reading.
