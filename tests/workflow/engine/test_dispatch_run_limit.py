"""The one park the dispatcher answers instead of the stage its label names.

An issue that has spent every agent run it is allowed is stopped for good, and
`awaiting_human` means something different on every road below: a resume on
the next trusted reply, a hold waiting on guidance, a classifier that refuses
a command carrying none. Each of those is right about the park it was written
against and none of them buys back a run, so the park is held once, ahead of
the table.

The exemption is the other half of it. What work that has ENDED reaches below
is a terminal that ends the issue rather than a road that spends anything on
it, so the hold steps aside and lets the ending finish. Two facts say so and
the free one is asked first: the issue object, and the PULL REQUEST the record
names -- a merge leaves the issue open until a stage terminal reads it, and a
close nobody merged leaves it open for good, so a spent issue behind either
would sit on a park nothing can lift over work a human already decided. The
`discussion` stage's own plan is carved out of that, since merging a design is
an agreement to build it rather than a delivery.

The ending is asked AHEAD of the command below, and the order is what these
pin: reading that command mutates -- an allowance widened, a park cleared, a
batch consumed, a receipt posted, a phase recorded -- and none of that is
anything work a human has already merged or closed should earn.

The command that buys an issue out of the park is asked by the same hold, for
the same reason it is held there: the ledger is spent by every role at every
stage, so no one handler is where a human would say it.
