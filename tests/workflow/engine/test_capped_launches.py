"""What still refuses a developer or reviewer launch ahead of the ledger.

The lifetime ledger is the backstop under the caps that were already there,
not a replacement for any of them, and the order matters in one direction: a
cap that fired only AFTER the charge would spend a run on work nothing ever
ran. So each case here drives a real handler over an issue whose own cap is
spent and pins the same facts -- no process, no charge standing, and a spend
the tick did not move.

The session budget refuses something narrower. It does not turn the tick away;
it retires the transcript the resume would have replayed, and what reaches the
boundary is one fresh spawn rather than a resume. Its sibling below is the
other half of that accounting: the single retry a poisoned session earns is
not a licence a spawn with no transcript also gets, so a fresh launch that
comes back poisoned is charged once and asks for nothing more.
