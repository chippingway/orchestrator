"""The record an agent-run budget transition leaves on both sinks.

What is pinned here is the contract a consumer reads rather than the roads
that reach it: one payload under two envelopes, the whole ledger reading on
every phase, an unlimited allowance that says so instead of counting, a
correlation that names a reservation only where one exists, a refusal that
explains itself from a closed vocabulary, and a record that survives the
Postgres replay with none of it dropped.
