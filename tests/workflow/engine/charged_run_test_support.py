"""The ledger a driven road is seeded on, and what one tick left on it.

The vocabulary both road tables beside this are written in -- the developer
and reviewer one, and the decomposer and conversation one. Every road either
drives is seeded here, on one ledger: an allowance with room under it, so a
case about a second launch is not secretly a case about the ceiling, and a
spend that is already non-zero, so a road that started the count over rather
than charging the one the issue carried is a road the numbers catch.

What a case reads afterwards is the issue's own pinned comment, never the
object the handler was holding. The charge is written onto freshly read
durable state in the middle of a tick and the handler writes again at the end
of one, so the count surviving that second write is half of what any of this
proves.

The two worlds a road is driven in besides its ordinary one live here for the
same reason: a run the shutdown sweep killed and a run an operator paused
mid-flight are what every road has to answer for, and each cost the issue the
same run as one that came back.
