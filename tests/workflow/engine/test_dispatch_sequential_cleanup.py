"""The freshness the path with no worker hand-off has to take for itself.

`parallel_limit == 1` dispatches on the caller thread, straight off the objects
the enumeration yielded. On the two labels where the CLOSE decides which
handler runs, a reading that old decides it wrongly in both directions. An
owner closed after the poll reaches the stage its label names -- spawning the
decomposer, or walking a dependency graph and activating children, on an issue
a human just ended. An owner reopened after the poll is swept as closed, and a
snapshot no consumer holds is deleted out from under a live cycle, because the
sweep's own re-read of the close would be re-reading the very object that
classified it.
