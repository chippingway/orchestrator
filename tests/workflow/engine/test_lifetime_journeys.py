"""How many agent processes one issue can start before something stops it.

The owners under the lifetime ledger each answer for their own step, and none
of them answers this: the number an operator sets is a number of PROCESSES,
and what turns it into one is every stage the issue walks, every tick it
takes, and the dispatcher that holds it once the runs are gone. So each case
here walks a real issue through a real loop under a small allowance and counts
what the runner was actually asked to start.

The count is read as the sum of what each tick spawned rather than off one
long-lived mock, because that is the reading a restarted process would take:
nothing carries the total between ticks but the issue's own pinned comment,
and each tick here builds its own patch set over it.
