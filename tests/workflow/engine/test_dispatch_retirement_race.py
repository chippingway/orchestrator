"""The record a poll reads while a worker is retiring the cycle it names.

A published `single` drops its generation and then asks the latch, and the
record says nothing at all in between -- no cycle identity, which is the one
thing every reader of a close consults. A poll that reads it there is reading
a record whose worker is still holding the question open, so what it may not
do is call the reading spent: the barrier behind the write would find nothing
latched, and the observation would be gone with no durable half either.
