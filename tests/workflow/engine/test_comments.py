"""Both directions of the comment owner.

The write side keeps the ledger every "is this comment ours?" scan reads: one
bounded id list spanning both comment surfaces, plus the hidden marker that
outlives eviction from it.

The read side is where `ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS` becomes a trust boundary. Every
conversation-carrying agent prompt draws its thread text through
`_recent_comments_text`, so an untrusted author's comment has to be dropped
whole -- body and any URLs it carries -- before a coding agent can act on it.
