"""The lifetime agent-run ledger: what an issue is allowed, and what it spent.

Four promises are pinned here, each one something a reader of the ledger is
written on: a count that starts from the legacy meter rather than from zero
and never reads below it, a count that only ever goes up -- including while
the ceiling is off -- an allowance the issue's own record governs where it
carries one, and a reservation whose two phases survive the trip through a
pinned comment as the wire strings live issues carry.
