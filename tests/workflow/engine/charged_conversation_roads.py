"""The decomposer and conversation roads that reach a process, and how each runs.

The sibling table beside this one carries the developer and the reviewer; this
one carries the three roles that TALK -- the decomposer deciding whether an
issue is one piece of work, the question stage answering somebody, and the
discussion stage arguing a design out. Each is here twice, because a
conversation's first round and the round a human's reply reopens are different
roads through the same handler, and only one of them carries a session to
resume, a park to clear, and a batch of replies to mark as read.

What is worth driving a real handler for is the same as it is there: the
charge is taken at one boundary, so what a road has to be held to is that it
GOES through that boundary carrying the issue it is spending. And these three
add a second thing to hold. Each stages something ahead of its spawn that its
own disposition owns -- a locked agent spec, a reply batch marked read, the
anchor a round opened on -- and none of it may be published by the charge that
lands in between.

The late adjudicator is the one decomposing road not in this table. It is not
a dispatched handler and runs inside a harness of its own, so its case lives
beside it in `tests/workflow/stages/decomposition/test_late_charged_run.py`.
