"""What a poll does with a close no pass has settled.

A closed owner on an adjudication label is submitted for its cleanup, and two
things can leave that submission unsettled. The scheduler admits no second
worker for an issue one is already running, and a pass that WAS admitted can
fail before it has marked anything -- the worker refetches the issue over
GitHub first, and that read can be the thing that breaks.

Every other refusal costs a turn: the work is still there next tick. These
cost an OBSERVATION -- the poll found the issue closed, and a human who
reopens it before the next pass takes that reading away for good.

So the observation is held rather than logged and dropped, in both cases. It
outlives the reading it came from, and the tick after routes the issue to the
sweep on the strength of it -- whatever the issue reads as by then, and
whichever bucket its label would otherwise have put it in. What the sweep
does with an owner that is open again is mark the cancellation the close
already earned and stop there.
