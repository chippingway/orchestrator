"""The loops one issue can sit in, and the runs each of them spends.

Every journey here is a shape an issue really gets stuck in, and each is
picked because something about it looks like it ought to buy more runs. A
review answered by a fix answered by a review has no natural end. A base that
moved is rebased onto and a conflict is recovered from, and each of those puts
the review round back to zero itself -- so the two journeys about them stage a
round that has been spent and let the tick reset it, which is the only way a
reset is worth asserting. A session that has been resumed to its limit is
retired and replaced. An issue that goes back to be decomposed and comes out
to be implemented again has changed stage, role, and prompt.

None of those returns a run, and that is the whole of what the table is for:
the counters they DO reset are round counters and session counters, and the
lifetime ledger is neither. A journey added here is a loop somebody found; a
loop nobody added is one nothing holds to the meter.

The late adjudicator is not in the table. It is not a dispatched handler and
runs inside a harness of its own, so its journey lives beside it in
`tests/workflow/stages/decomposition/test_late_lifetime.py`.
