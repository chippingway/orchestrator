"""One closed `implementing` owner, and the submits offered for it.

Shared by the two modules that ask about the same window from either end:
what a REFUSED submit was carrying, and what the record says while a worker
is retiring the cycle a close would end. Both drive the dispatcher's own
partition and submit rather than calling the deferral directly, since half of
what either is about is which reading that path establishes.
