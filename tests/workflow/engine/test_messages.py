Two behaviors carry the weight here. A drift acknowledgement needs the
explicit `ACK:` marker, so a clarification question is never mistaken for
agreement. And `/orchestrator continue` is classified before it is obeyed, so
a content-free nudge retries a session failure but is refused on a park that
is waiting for a real answer.
