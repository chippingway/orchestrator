"""The same observation hold, on the two ticks that run without a scheduler.

`parallel_limit` picks one of three paths: the scheduler's submit, a
sequential stream on the polling thread, and a bounded fan-out. All three run
the same cleanup route over a closed late-split owner, so all three have to
keep the same thing when that pass fails -- the OBSERVATION, which is the
reading a human who reopens the issue before the next tick takes off the
remote for good.

Neither direct path has the scheduler's wrapper to do it, and the failure they
have to survive is the first thing a cleanup spends: the refetch it opens with.

The sequential path classifies for itself rather than taking a hand-off, so it
is also where the two questions about a cleanup label are told apart: a CLOSED
issue is routed by any of the four, while only the two an adjudication runs
under earn the refetch an OPEN one costs.
