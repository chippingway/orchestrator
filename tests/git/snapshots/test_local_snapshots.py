"""Real git: where a fetched snapshot lands, and what reclaims it.

A remote ref is unique inside the repository that holds it, so three numbers
are enough there. The clone those repositories are fetched into is not: several
`REPOS` entries may share one `target_root` -- a single checkout with a public
and a private remote is the shape the per-issue branch namespace already exists
for -- and their ref stores are the same store. These cases drive two real
repositories through one clone and assert that neither ends up reading the
other's candidate.
