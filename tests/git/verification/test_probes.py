"""HEAD, dirty-file, and tree probing owned by the verification probe module.

The two answers the status read can give are pinned separately on purpose. A
caller that refuses on what git NAMED wants the list, where an unreadable tree
and a clean one are both "nothing to refuse on"; a caller whose next step is a
push has to prove the tree is clean, and for it the difference between the two
is the whole question.
