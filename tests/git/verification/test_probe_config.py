"""What the probes read when the worktree answers for itself.

Every probe below runs against a real repository rather than a mocked `git`,
because what is being pinned is git's own behaviour: the worktree's
`.git/config` is inside the tree an agent writes to, and the knobs planted here
change what a command reports without failing it. A mock could only assert the
flags were passed; only real git can show that passing them is what makes the
answer true.

Each test proves the trap first. It plants the knob, runs the command the way a
caller reading defaults would, and asserts the planted setting really did hide
the evidence -- otherwise a probe that quietly stopped passing its flags would
still pass here, on a repository where there was nothing to hide.

The base-commit test is the same shape without any config: the local
`refs/remotes/<remote>/<base>` ref is agent-writable too, since a linked
worktree shares the object store, so a diff that names that ref can be pointed
at whatever the agent likes.

The replacement tests go one further. Naming a commit by object id is only
worth something if the object id still means that commit: `refs/replace/<oid>`
and the graft file both tell git to serve something else under the same name,
and neither is config, so nothing the hardened envelope overrides with `-c`
reaches them. What answers them is the pair of environment variables the
envelope also sets, and these are what prove it.
