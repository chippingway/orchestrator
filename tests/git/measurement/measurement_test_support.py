"""A real remote, a candidate worktree, and the transports pointed at them.

Every counting test runs against git rather than against a mocked reading of
it, because the things being pinned down are git's own: what `--numstat`
reports for a path it calls binary, what a moved file looks like with rename
detection off, and which commits a three-dot range between two frozen ids
resolves. A fake would answer whatever the test expected, which is the one
answer that proves nothing here.

The candidate lives in a linked worktree of the clone, the way an issue's
checkout really does, so the object store a measurement reads is the store the
agent could write into -- which is what makes the remote-authoritative base
read worth testing at all.
