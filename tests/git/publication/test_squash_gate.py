"""The publication a squash-on-approval may rewrite, and what refuses it.

The squash force-pushes onto a pull request the remote already carries, so it
goes through the same post-publication gate the other nine pushes do -- the
measurement included, on the commit the squash MADE, since that is the object
the push would put on the pull request. The cases below are the refusals it
owes on the way in; `SquashSizeGateRealGitTest` beside them is the reading it
owes once there is a commit to take one over.

One of those refusals is a hole a lease cannot cover: CLOSING a pull request
does not move its branch, so a `--force-with-lease` still succeeds against a
publication nobody can merge. That is why the entry is asked while the branch
is still intact -- refused, the reviewer-approved commits stay exactly where
they are and the caller parks for a human.
