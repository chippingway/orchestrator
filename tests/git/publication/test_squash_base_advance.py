"""The pre-tick base refresh, over a branch a squash is mid-way through.

The refresh runs ahead of every handler, so it is the one thing that can move
a branch between the tick that collapsed it and the tick that would finish the
publication. A collapse is proved by the tree the commit on the branch carries
-- a squash rewinds with the index intact and commits again, so the object it
makes has the tree of the head it replaced, exactly -- and a rebase replaces
that with a commit carrying the base advance too. Rebased inside the window,
the recovery refuses and the pull request is left standing on the history the
record says was collapsed, with the rebase already force-pushed over it.
