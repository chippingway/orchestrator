"""The fork point one revision left the base at, read out of a real repository.

The base a contribution is measured over, and the one reading a rebase moves:
the commit it replayed forked at the tip the base used to be, and the commit
it produced forks at the tip it is now. A double that answered either would be
answering what a case seeded rather than what the objects say, and the whole
use of this probe is that the two really differ.

The refusals are read here too, because "" has to mean a reading that did not
HAPPEN rather than a base of no length: a revision this store does not hold,
and a base ref nothing ever fetched, are each evidence a caller cannot produce
and must not fingerprint over.
