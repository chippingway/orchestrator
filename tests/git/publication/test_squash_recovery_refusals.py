"""What a recovery refuses, and what it leaves the branch standing on.

A resumed collapse asks for its publication exactly as a fresh squash does, so
every refusal a squash owes is one a recovery owes too -- a pull request a
human closed while the process was down, a remote somebody else moved, a tree
that stopped being provably clean. None of them is repaired here.

Which way the branch goes is one rule read from its ends: it may be put back
onto the head the record names only where nothing durable claims the commit on
it. Put back wrongly, the retry finds one commit and reports there is nothing
to squash; left standing wrongly, a human is asked to reconcile a branch that
never needed it.
