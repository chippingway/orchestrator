"""The worktree window the durable record of a collapse opens.

Every reading the squash takes before it rewrites anything -- the planning
probes, and the entry's own proof of the tree and the head -- happens before
the terms of the collapse go onto the pinned comment. That write is a request,
so the worktree is writable for the whole of it, and what the rewrite behind
it commits is the INDEX rather than the plan: a `--soft` reset keeps whatever
is staged, and the commit that follows carries it.

Left unchecked, a change staged in that window is collapsed into the squash
and force-pushed onto the pull request as work a reviewer approved. So the
checkout is proved again once the write comes back, and both halves are
proved: a tree that is no longer provably clean, and a head something moved.
