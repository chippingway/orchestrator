"""A history one of whose commits was written with no message at all.

`git commit --allow-empty-message` makes one, and it is the shape that pulls
the count and the subject list apart: it contributes no subject to the message
the squash is built from and one commit to the branch. Counted from the
subjects, a branch of three reads as two -- so the record a squash writes
before it rewrites is short, and the recovery that walks the history back
refuses a collapse it really did make as miscounted -- while a branch of two
reads as a single commit and takes the nothing-to-squash road, reporting
success without measuring or pushing anything.
