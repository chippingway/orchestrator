"""What a tick coming back to a half-finished squash does with the branch.

A squash collapses the commits a reviewer approved into one object with the
same tree, so the branch it leaves behind is indistinguishable from a branch
nobody ever squashed. Read as the second, the interrupted rotation takes the
nothing-to-squash road and is reported as a success that measured nothing and
pushed nothing -- with approved work reaching the merge button neither counted
nor on the remote.

The record the squash writes before it runs is what tells them apart, and each
case here stops one run at one seam and asks what the tick after it does. The
rewrite is real git against a real bare remote, so the branch every assertion
is about is the branch the recovery really found. What a resume REFUSES is
pinned down beside this, in `test_squash_recovery_refusals.py`.
