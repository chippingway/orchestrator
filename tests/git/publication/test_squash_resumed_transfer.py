"""The exemption an interrupted squash still carries when it is finished.

The evidence a transfer is granted on is destroyed by the very rewrite it is
about: the head that was collapsed is off the branch and the base it was read
over is not derivable from the object that replaced it. A squash that died
before it reached the gate therefore has no plan left to offer one, and the
record it wrote beforehand is what the resumed publication offers instead --
the same pair, over the same base.

Both readings here are the real ones, at a ceiling the accepted candidate is
already past: without the transfer either case is the oversized reading that
routes an approved pull request back into adjudication on the last push before
the merge button.
