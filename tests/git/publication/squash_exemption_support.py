"""The issue one adjudicated squash runs on, and the writes it makes.

A `single` verdict leaves an exemption naming the commit a human ruled on and
the canonical digest of what that commit contributes. Every case about a
transfer starts from exactly that comment, so the seeding lives here rather
than in whichever module happened to need it first.

The two write doubles are the other half. A squash's durable writes are the
crash boundaries it can be interrupted at, so a case says WHICH write it is
about -- the terms of the collapse, the permission that licenses the push, or
the receipt that settles it -- rather than counting to one.
