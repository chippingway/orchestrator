"""The records one squash scenario is seeded and reported by.

A squash-on-approval force-pushes onto a pull request the remote already
carries, so the size gate is entered on that publication first: readable,
open, standing on the head this stage read, over a provably clean tree, and
under the ceiling once the squashed commit is measured against the frozen
base. A scenario about the rewrite therefore has to give it one to be entered
on, and a scenario about the refusals moves or closes the pull request it
seeds here.

`SquashRun` is the other end: what the squash decided, beside the push seam
that recorded whether anything went out and under what name.
