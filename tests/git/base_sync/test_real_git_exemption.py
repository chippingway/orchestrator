"""The refresh-time rebase of an adjudicated commit, against a real repository.

The exemption names one commit and only it, and the per-tick refresh takes the
branch off that commit as soon as the base moves: past the handoff a pushed
branch is kept in step with base by the PR-aware sync, which force-pushes a
replay nothing exempts. Measured afresh that replay is oversized again -- the
same lines, over an equivalent base -- and a pull request already open over the
work goes back into adjudication.

Every reading here is the real one: a real remote, a real base advance, a real
rebase, and the canonical fingerprint taken over the actual objects on both
sides of the replay. Only the authenticated push is stood in for, and only the
remote-side base freeze, which these fixtures have no token to reach.
