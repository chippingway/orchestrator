"""What the size gate reads when a base refresh is about to push.

A refresh that rebases onto a base that has moved changes what the branch adds
to it, so its push goes through the same gate every other one does. These
answer the four readings that gate takes -- a provably clean tree, a candidate
this host holds, a base the remote named, and a count -- so a base-sync test
says nothing about size unless it is about size, and one that IS about size
seeds exactly the reading it is about.
