"""The commit a published rebase pushes is the one it then finalizes.

The refresh reads the post-rebase head for itself, and the size gate proves
the checkout's head again before it measures. Between the two reads the
worktree is writable, so what the push carries and what the notice, the audit
event, and the `validating` route name have to be one decision -- otherwise a
commit landing in that window reaches the pull request while the tail
finalizes the head this owner read.
