"""What one clean auto rebase hands the size gate, and what the gate does with it.

The refresh is the seam: it knows the pre-rebase anchor its force-push is
leased against, the head the replay left, and the base that replay was made
onto, and none of the three survives anything else running. What it does with
them is assemble the evidence a transfer is decided on -- beside the pair the
adjudication already recorded, which is the only pair a verdict may move off.

Nothing here rules on that evidence. What these cases pin is the wiring: the
terms the gate is handed, that an equivalent replay publishes and rotates
without a reading, that a base advance which changed the contribution falls
back to the ordinary cumulative gate, and that evidence this refresh cannot
assemble is no claim at all.

The crash road is here for the same reason. The gate records the debt this
push is owed BEFORE the push goes out, so a process dying in between comes
back to a rebased branch, an unpushed remote, and an anchor still pinned --
and what has to happen next is this refresh's own recovery finishing the
route, not a later stage landing the push and leaving the reviewer looking at
a head nothing routed them to.
