"""The adjudicated issue one refresh-time rebase is decided over, as doubles.

The composed refresh takes the readings a transfer turns on and no other
base-sync case seeds: which commit each revision proves to, what the REMOTE
says the base branch is at, and what each of the two contributions
fingerprints to. They are answered here as one world -- the ordinary one, in
which the replay contributes exactly what the adjudication accepted -- so a
case about a refusal moves the single answer it is about and says nothing
else.

The revisions are keyed rather than sequenced because the permit asks about
two different things: the checkout's own head and the pre-rebase anchor its
force-push is leased against. A positional double would silently swap them the
moment that order changed.

The base is answered by the freeze rather than by peeling a local ref, because
that is the reading the production evidence takes: the ref a rebase names
lives in a store the agent writes to, so what a transfer is granted over has
to be the base the remote itself answers for.
