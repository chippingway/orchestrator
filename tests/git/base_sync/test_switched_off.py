"""What a base refresh does on an install with the size gate switched off.

`DECOMPOSE=off` decides what ENTERS the gate, and both seams here enter it
with fresh work: the commit a rebase rewrites the branch into, and the commit
an interrupted tick left ahead of the remote. No developer ran on either, and
that is exactly the fact these cases pin down as the WRONG one to answer the
switch with -- nothing on the pinned comment asked for either commit to be
read, so neither is a reading this gate already took.

Read as reconciliations they would be measured anyway, which is the failure an
operator who turned the gate off would meet as a pull request nobody grew
being routed into an adjudication it never opted into.
