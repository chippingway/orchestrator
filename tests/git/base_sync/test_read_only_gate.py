"""The per-tick base refresh leaves both read-only stages' checkouts alone.

Neither stage ships code, so a checkout under one of their labels is something
to read rather than work in progress -- an inspection target an unsafe park
left an operator, and, in the discussion stage which keeps its tree on every
exit short of the terminal that finishes the issue, the state the next round is
meant to open on. The refresh runs before any handler does, so without this
gate a tick would rebase
`origin/<base>` over that tree, and it would do it on exactly the parked issues
the handlers themselves never touch again.

The discussion stage does push once -- the plan its humans confirmed, from its
own publication and onto a pull request of that file alone -- which is why the
gate reads that stage's in-flight records as well as its parks: a rebase over
the commit a publication is mid-way through pushing would move the branch off
the very tip the record names.
