"""What one maintenance pass takes, what it refuses, and what it leaves behind.

The mutations are run for real: `worktree remove` against a tree on disk, a
leased delete against a bare repository, and a pinned `update-ref` against the
clone's own ref store. That is the whole point of the cases below -- what makes
this pass safe is that git and the remote refuse it when the world has moved,
and a fixture standing in for either would assert the pass's own reading back
at it.

What is asserted after a pass is the state of the host and the remote rather
than the calls it made, since that is what an operator is left with. The one
exception is the pair of failure cases, where a step that would not run is
installed on the owner that defines it: neither a bare repository nor a local
ref store can be made to turn a valid deletion down.
