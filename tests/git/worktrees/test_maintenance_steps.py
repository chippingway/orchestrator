"""What each teardown step refuses on its own, before any pass composes them.

The pass reads the world and then acts on it, and between those two things a
race can put anything at all in front of the mutation. What stands there is not
the pass's reading -- it is git's and the remote's, at the moment of the write:
a removal that does not force, a delete leased to a commit, and a ref deletion
that names both the value it expects and its refusal to follow a symbolic name.

Each of the three is driven here against a real tree, a real bare repository,
and a real ref store, with the world moved out from under it first. A double
would prove only that the arguments were assembled.
