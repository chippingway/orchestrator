"""The host and remote a candidate discovery is read off, both of them real.

The world is the artifact classification's own -- a clone, the bare repository
its authenticated transport is pointed at, and the checkouts under a redirected
worktrees root -- because every part of the question is something git answers:
the namespace listing, the ref store the local half comes from, the exact names
the attribution re-derives and compares, and the git directory that says which
clone a checkout carrying no name at all is a worktree of. A double of any of
them would hand the fixture's own answer back.

Nothing here reaches GitHub. What the discovery decides is where an issue's
artifacts are and who they belong to, which is settled entirely between the
host and the remotes it publishes to.
