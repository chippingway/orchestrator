"""What a maintenance pass finds on a host and on the remote beside it.

The local scan already answers for what a host holds; what is pinned down here
is the half it cannot answer -- a branch this clone no longer has a ref for --
and the reading that says which layout an issue was published under.

Driven against real clones, real branches, real checkouts, and real bare
remotes, because every part of the question is something git answers: the
namespace listing, the ref store the local half is read from, the exact names
attribution re-derives and compares, and the git directory that says which
clone a checkout carrying no name at all is a worktree of. The multi-repository
cases are built both ways round for that last one -- two entries on one clone,
where the flat checkout is nobody's, and two entries on their own clones, where
each is answered for.
