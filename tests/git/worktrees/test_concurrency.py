"""Per-`target_root` serialization of the worktree creators.

`tick()` fans non-family-aware stages out across worker threads, so the
creators can run concurrently against one `spec.target_root`. The git they
run -- `git fetch`, `git worktree add`, `git worktree remove` -- writes the
parent clone's `.git/config` under `.git/config.lock`, and without
per-target_root serialization git reports `error: could not lock config
file .git/config: File exists` and the worker fails before its agent ever
spawns. Both a deterministic blocking-fake unit test and a real-git smoke
test pin the contract down.
