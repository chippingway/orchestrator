"""Clones, checkouts, and specs the local artifact scan is read from.

Real repositories and real directories rather than doubles: what the scan
reads IS a ref store and a directory listing, so a fake of either would only
hand the fixture back. The branch names the tests compare against are spelled
out here instead of derived, so a change to the naming in ``paths`` fails
these tests rather than travelling through them unnoticed.
