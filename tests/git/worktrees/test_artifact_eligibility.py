"""Which discovered candidates may be reclaimed, over a real host and a double.

The three shapes a scan reports, the claims that keep a candidate whatever the
host says, and the proof each artifact has to give. Driven against real clones,
real branches, real checkouts, and a real bare remote, because what makes a
candidate eligible is what git and that remote answer about it -- a stub of
the probes would only assert the classifier's own table back, and the local
refs an agent can write are exactly what must not be able to answer here.

The issue and its pull requests are the in-memory double, so the ending and
the claims are set where a case needs them rather than reached for over the
network.
