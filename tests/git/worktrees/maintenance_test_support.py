"""The finished issue a maintenance pass runs over, on a real host and remote.

The world is the artifact classification's own -- a clone, the bare repository
its authenticated transport is pointed at, and the checkouts under a redirected
worktrees root -- because a pass is only worth testing against the things it
actually mutates: `worktree remove` refusing a tree it has been written in, a
leased delete the remote turns down, a ref store that will not let go of a
branch that has moved. A double of any of them would hand the fixture's own
answer back.

What is doubled is the issue and its pull requests, through the in-memory
client, since the ending a candidate needs is a fact about GitHub rather than
about the host.

The quiet period is real too, which is why every case that expects a pass to
act back-dates the checkout first: a tree created moments ago is one this pass
is designed to leave alone, and a fixture that patched the constant away would
stop testing the guard that says so.
