"""The host a terminal-artifact classification reads: clone, remote, checkouts.

Real throughout, and the remote most of all. What the classification asks the
host IS a ref store, a working tree, and a remote's answer about a branch, so
a double of any of them would hand the fixture back instead of git -- and the
one thing these probes exist to prove is that a local ref an agent can write
cannot stand in for what the remote says. A bare repository on disk is what
makes the difference between the two visible: `refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>`
can be pointed anywhere while the remote goes on answering what it actually
holds.

The commits are written with `commit-tree` straight into the object store. A
branch carrying work and a branch sitting exactly on base are two refs and
nothing else here reads a working tree to find that out, so there is no reason
to check anything out to make one.
