# unpushed-commit probe, the two creators, the new-commit probe, the reported
# fetch and the start point a restore picks, the handoff anchor with the target
# choice, the ref move, and the revision read under it, and the `worktree` argv
# they run, the decomposer's path, creation, and removal, the per-issue removal
# and local branch deletion, the two teardowns composed from them, and the local
# artifact scan: the two records it answers with, the branch listing and the
# checkout reads under it, the flat pre-namespacing checkouts among them, the
# identity read that says which clone one of those is a worktree of, the
# attribution rules for a branch, for a checkout directory, and for a flat
# checkout no name can settle -- the record carrying the owner it found beside
# the claimants nobody may act for, and the reporting behind it -- the clone
# resolution, the grouping over it and the shape that grouping takes, the one
# filing what a repository holds apart from what it may not touch, and the
# per-clone, per-repository, and per-issue assembly. Then the classification
# over what that scan found: the three-answer probe vocabulary, the two records
# a verdict is made of and the commit it hands over when it clears one, the
# nine fail-closed reads -- the ignored-path one that answers for what a status
# leaves out among them, the one asking when a tree was last disturbed, over the
# checkout's own git directory and the two files in it a commit rewrites, and
# the one asking which branches a tree of the clone is standing on, counted
# against the clone's own worktree entries because git drops one whose backlink
# is missing without saying so -- and the two runners under them, the issue,
# pinned-state, and pull-request reads GitHub answers with and the boundaries
# around each of them, and the composition that turns both into one verdict per
# candidate, with every checkout read on its own against the base and the branch
# tips the whole candidate shares, that checkout's three-read order and the
# record carrying what it is measured against, the tables each of those is
# charged through, the tip read that falls back to the remote, the HEAD read
# spent twice, and the proof an eligible verdict is handed over as. Then the
# pass that spends one of those verdicts: the discovery over both halves at
# once -- the remote listing and the namespace pattern it asks for, the
# attribution and the grouping over it, the layout reading and the merge that
# widens one candidate, and the whole scan those produce -- the three
# commit-pinned teardown steps and the argv each runs, and the pass itself: the
# injected guard's type, the quiet period, the reason-to-outcome table, and
# every gate, step, and answer between them. Naming the whole surface makes a
# helper added to an owner an edit here rather than a definition site nothing
# checks.
