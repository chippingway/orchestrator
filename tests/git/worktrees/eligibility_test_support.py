"""The issue a terminal-artifact classification asks GitHub about.

The remote half of the fixture: an issue in whatever ending a case needs, the
pinned state it recorded, and the pull requests standing on its branches, all
through the in-memory double. The host half -- the clone, its remote, and the
checkouts -- is the ``candidate_host_test_support`` beside it.

The double is used rather than a stub of the client, because what these cases
turn on is which answer a lookup gives: a pull request open on another base,
a recorded number nothing resolves, a commit list GitHub refuses. Each of
those is something the double already models the way the real client does.
