"""A real bare remote plus the worlds and drivers the creation tests run in.

`_RealGitWorktreeRepo` is the shared floor: a bare remote, a clone of it as
`target_root`, and the token-bearing fetch redirected at that path.
`_AmendedPlanRepo` builds the one shape the plan handoff faces on top of it --
a per-issue checkout on the plan this orchestrator published, and a different
head on the remote, committed from a second clone the way a reviewer's own edit
to a plan PR arrives.
