"""The commit-pinned pull-request lookup, and its three possible answers.

`find_pr_for_commit` is what a publication that crashed before recording its
number is recovered by, and its caller PUSHES on a `None`. So the difference
between "no pull request carries this commit" and "nobody could say" is the
difference between finishing that publication and republishing over one that
already landed: after the plan PR was amended, squash-merged, and had its head
branch auto-deleted, a miss has the branch recreated and a second pull request
opened that proposes taking the amendment back out.

The head and the commit list are asked in that order because they cost
differently and answer differently. The head is a field already in hand and
covers the ordinary case; the commit list is a request to GitHub, and the only
place a merged-and-amended publication is still visible.

The enumeration those are read from is a request too, and its pages are a
request each, so the candidate that would have matched can be one the walk
never reaches. That is the same "nobody could say" one level up, and it is
tested the same way: the failure has to be told apart from a branch with no
pull requests on it, because only one of the two is safe to publish over.
