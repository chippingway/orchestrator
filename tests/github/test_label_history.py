"""The one question about an issue's PAST this client answers.

A label removed leaves the issue looking exactly like one that never carried
it, so a caller deciding whether a write of its own ever landed has nothing on
the issue's surface to read. The events endpoint is what remembers, and what
this reads back off it is the newest workflow label THIS orchestrator applied
-- which is a narrower thing than "was that label ever there", in the two ways
that matter.

The events are shaped as PyGithub serves them, because every filter here is
over a field of that shape: the event kind, the actor's login, and the label's
name. A double that carried only what a caller happened to need would answer
the same for a collaborator's label as for the orchestrator's own.
