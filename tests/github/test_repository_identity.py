"""Which repository a client speaks for, and whether a head belongs to it.

Three owners refuse a publication on this answer -- the size gate's entry
freeze, the delivery proof behind a publication receipt, and the settlement's
own reconciliation -- and each of them is deciding whether a pull request it
just read is one THIS repository could have published. Nothing on the pull
request itself says so: a fork carries this repository's ref names over its
commits, so the branch and the head agree while the publication is somebody
else's entirely.
