"""What the page draws between its read waves, and when it stops drawing.

The chrome, the banners, and the strip are what an operator watches while the
second wave is still out, so the cases below drive each pass against the
recording page in `page_render_test_support` and read back which region it
wrote into. The one case that is not about markup is the short circuit: a
window that matched no row hands nothing back, and that return is what ends the
load before the panels beneath it are paid for.
