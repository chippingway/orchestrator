"""What one page load reads, in which wave, and under which key.

Streamlit lives in the optional `dashboard` dependency group, so the cases
below hand a wave a stand-in that records what it was asked to cache and hands
each reader back unwrapped -- which is the whole of what this owner reaches
Streamlit for. That is also what makes a built task readable: the callable in
it is the adapter with its arguments already bound, so a case can name the read
an entry spends its key on rather than standing a database up to watch rows
come back.

The keys are built by the filter and window owners rather than written out
here, because what a wave owes a page is its own keys passed through untouched
-- hand-rolled tuples would keep passing after the two spellings drifted apart.
