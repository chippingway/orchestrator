"""What the page says when it has nothing to draw, and how it signs off.

Streamlit lives in the optional `dashboard` dependency group, so the cases
below hand each render a stand-in recording the markup, the notices, and the
stop that ends the script -- which is the whole of what this owner reaches
Streamlit for. All three land in one list as well, so a case can say what was
drawn before the script ended rather than only that it did. The theme is faked
the same way, marking every reading a formatter was handed, so a count reaching
the markup raw can be told from one the page shortened.
