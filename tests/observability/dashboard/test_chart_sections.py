"""The order a window's figure cards are drawn in, and what each is handed.

Every card here is its own owner and pinned beside it; what this owner decides
is which of them the second wave reaches first and which read family each is
given. The cases stub every panel on the module that holds it -- which is also
the check that the pass names the owners rather than resolving a render off a
facade -- and answer each read with its own key, so a card handed the wrong
family reads back as the wrong word.
