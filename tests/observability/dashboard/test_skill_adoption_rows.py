"""What one cell of the adoption table says, and how it is drawn.

The cases lead with the two ways a cell can be quiet, because keeping them
apart is the reason the panel counts sessions rather than runs: a skill nobody
was offered has no denominator and reports an undefined rate, while one that
was offered and loaded by nobody reports a real zero -- the offered-but-ignored
finding the panel exists to surface. Beside them are the whole-point rate a
busy cell reports, the two diagnostics that are counted apart so neither can be
read as adoption, the source level that keeps two definitions of one name
apart, the label an empty category is bucketed under, and the escaping every
naming column arrives needing.
