# What each owner answers for, declared rather than discovered so a second way
# to resolve a color, lay a chart out, shorten a number, spell a window, lay
# out the bar one is picked in, offer the presets that name one, turn the days
# typed into that bar back into a window,
# normalize a selection, key a cached read, read that key back as a read's
# filters, decide which way a load's reads are issued, stage that load into the
# two waves it is drawn in, run one wave of them that way, drive both waves
# around the render between them, check out the connection one of them runs on,
# draw a headline or lifecycle section from one of the seven reads behind it, a
# comparison panel from one of the six, or a skill panel from one of the three,
# open a page on the extent behind its filter bar, interrupt one with a banner,
# reduce its window to the four numbers a headline tile reports, plot the days
# behind three of them, assemble all four into the strip a page opens with,
# place one of those days on the line under a tile and write that line as the
# SVG the tile carries, banner what the database holds above that strip,
# restate what a run's filters narrowed it to, and annotate one of its tiles
# with the move it made,
# head a card and draw that banner and those numbers as the markup a browser
# reads, list a panel's rows in the compact table beside them, rank a window's
# issues into the first of those panels, report a cohort's skill-trigger rate
# in the second, read a page URL back as the order the third or the fourth is
# drawn in, head one of their columns as the control that writes that URL, say
# what one of their cells was offered, loaded, or triggered, assemble either
# panel those cells are sorted into, draw the card the adoption one leads and
# the two invocation views fold under together with the caption that names what
# a quiet window did record, draw the trigger-rate card a caller reaching past
# that one still gets, pair the lifecycle bars a window's spend is split across
# at the one height both are drawn at, rank that window's issues beside the
# backends that ran them, set that window's repositories beside the tiles and
# days the runs behind them are read for, lay the tokens under all of those out
# by the hour and weekday they landed on and name the zone that grid is read
# in, weigh
# one backend's spend against the
# tokens and runs behind it, size a window's
# priced share into one bar, read one of the runs under all of them back as
# the columns it is scanned by, trace one issue's events under that listing,
# read a historical call back as the state that trace is drawn from, draw the
# card above all of them on the stack an operator picked and total a day's
# tokens per backend for it, answer a database with nothing in it or a window
# matching nothing with the state a page leaves through, close a page that did
# draw on the span and run count it was drawn over, offer the sidebar a run of
# that page is narrowed in, read the zone its timestamps are displayed against
# back off the session, resolve one pass through those controls into what every
# read is bounded by, stage the load they open, fill the two slots that band
# left above the panels and raise the banners between them, drive the staged
# load the strip is drawn inside, stack the five figure cards that load
# answers for, close the page on the four panels beneath them, or carry what a
# render was
# narrowed to from
# the controls at the top of the page down to those panels is a
# deliberate edit rather than a place two panels -- or the reads' `ts < end`
# bound and the cache's tri-state -- could disagree. Four owners report
# nothing. Three of them because the check reads `__module__`, which only a
# class or a function
# carries: the geometry owner's whole surface is its measurements and the two
# font stacks, the stylesheet owner's is one string, and the render-config
# owner's is the single mapping every figure is drawn under. The fourth
# declares nothing of its own at all -- the theme a page hands every panel it
# draws is the five style owners read back under one name, so each value on it
# is the object one of them already holds. The palette's
# chrome
# colors and seven dimension maps, the preset vocabulary the window owner
# decides together with the three of those the control owner beside it offers
# inline, the read-mode owner's knob name, truthy spellings, worker cap,
# refusal message, and the flag its import binds, the alias the fan-out owner
# names a reader by, the TTL the read plan caches a wave's entries under, the
# spinner message the dispatch owner opens a load under together with the
# mapping a wave hands back and the logger its load line is emitted on, the cap
# the rollup owner reads a run list under, the two bands the insight owner
# raises a banner at and the spellings an unpriced run reaches it under, the
# columns the issue table is headed by and the rules its bars and pills are
# painted from, the columns and rate-bar rules the skill-trigger table beside it
# is drawn with together with the label it reads a category the sink left empty
# under, the row and base measurements the paired lifecycle bars are sized from
# and the notice the backend cards beside that ranking answer a window with no
# run with,
# the nine columns the adoption table is read across and the seven the
# trigger matrix is, each with the two query parameters its headings write and
# the counts among them a first click sorts down, the rules either scopes to
# its own class and the notice each renders in place of a table, the notice the
# trigger-rate card answers a window with no run at all with, the KPI
# owner's ranking cap and rework buckets, the floor the projection owner
# clamps a flat window's span at, the default box the rendering owner beside it
# draws a line in together with the keyword surface it binds one through, the
# two historical surfaces the chrome owner past them binds its pill and its
# banner through, the
# triple the
# strip owner hands its four entries back as, the label the run listing is
# collapsed under together with the notice a window with no run renders
# instead, the notice the trace beneath that listing answers a number typed
# before a repository with and the declared signature the adapter beside it
# binds a historical call through, the two messages an un-ingested database and
# a window nothing matched are answered with, the heading the sidebar is titled
# by together with the option its repository box names no repository under and
# the three help texts its other controls are qualified by, the two stack modes
# the hero card is drawn
# in together with the title, subtitle, and toggle label above them and the two
# keys the picked one is remembered and keyed by, and the TTL the metadata owner
# caches under are all
# invisible here for the same reason.

# What an owner here may reach: its siblings, plus the analytics owners named
# by the ones that touch a database. Each of those is one answer already
# decided elsewhere, so the owner that needs it names the owner that gives it
# rather than a facade in front of one: the extent a preset anchors at is a
# read's answer, whether there is a database to read at all is one knob's, the
# socket a read runs on is the connection cache's, the exception a failed read
# arrives as is the connection owner's, the two unfiltered reads a page opens
# with are the raw read family's, the seven a headline or lifecycle section is
# drawn from are the rollup, breakdown, and raw families' -- with the ordering
# one of them asks for spelled by the issue-summary owner that reads it -- the
# six a comparison panel is drawn from are the rollup and breakdown families',
# the three a skill panel is drawn from are the skill family's, and the totals
# and cost-source split a banner is raised over -- and the window totals a tile
# reports, the pair of windows the strip beneath it is reduced from, the issue
# rows a table is ranked from, the cohort rows the trigger-rate panel beneath it
# reports, the adoption cells and the matrix cells four of each panel's five
# owners order, parse for, reduce, and assemble -- and the two panel owners
# above all three of those tables are handed a window's worth of each -- the
# per-backend and per-cost-source rows the two card owners weigh and size, and
# the run rows the listing under all of them is projected from -- are the rows
# those reads hand back, and the trace under that listing names the raw family
# for the per-issue read it is the only page caller of.
# The two cost-comparison panels are handed four of
# those row families for the same reason and issue no read of their own: each
# is what the section it draws is typed against, and what it draws that section
# with -- a header, a ranking, a table, a card, a bar, a figure -- is the
# sibling owner that already decided it, down to the toolbar every figure is
# configured by.
# The page-state owner names two of those result
# families for the same reason without issuing a read of its own: the extent a
# page opened on and the window totals a comparison panel reports are what the
# shapes it threads are typed against, and the owner holding the two states a
# page leaves through with the line it ends on names the same pair, since the
# banner an un-ingested database is answered with and the footer a drawn page
# closes on are typed
# against those two readings. That owner is also the one place a sibling render
# is called rather than a shape: an empty window hands the page on to the trace
# at the foot of it, which is scoped by an issue rather than by the cache key
# the reads it skipped share. The owner at the top of the page names no result
# family at all, because what a run is narrowed by is decided out of the
# selections an operator made rather than out of anything read back: its whole
# reach is six siblings -- the bar the days are picked in and the window that
# bar resolves to, the normalization and default offset a selection is read
# through, the knob deciding how the load is issued and the plan staging it,
# and the shapes all of it is threaded on as. The panel below those two is typed
# against the shapes rather than the rows, so the page state is the only
# vocabulary it names, while the grid beneath it is back to the rows and names
# the activity family for the weekday-by-hour points it draws. The owner
# drawing the chrome between the two waves names two result families without
# issuing a read either -- the window aggregate its banner, filter line, and
# strip are all reduced from, and the cost-source rows one of its banners is
# raised over -- while the two that only order the panels beneath name no
# result family at all, since every row they hand on arrived with the load:
# their whole reach is the panels themselves plus the shapes those are typed
# against, and the second of the two names the first because one call has to
# draw the page's whole order. One sibling is a
# package rather than a
# module: the four owners that draw a figure inside a card name the chart
# families that build it -- the hero card one, the paired lifecycle bars two,
# the repository ranking beside the run-health tiles two more, and that grid
# one --
# since a panel is the card and the figure together and a handle passed in
# would let them be assembled from different families, which for a pairing
# pinned to one shared height is two panels measured apart.
