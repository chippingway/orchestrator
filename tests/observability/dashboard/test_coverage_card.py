"""What share of a window's spend the bar says was priced, and how it is sized.

The whole point of the bar is which denominator it divides by, so the cases
name a window where the two disagree: one source carrying most of the tokens
out of a small minority of the runs. Token share is what an operator is exposed
to when a pricing table has a gap, and run share only stands in for a window
that has not reported a token yet -- a window reporting neither divides by one
rather than raising, because a page is opened on an empty window precisely to
find out that it is empty.

The bar and the legend under it are read together, since a segment is built as
both at once: the same hue and the same percentage have to appear in each, the
hue comes off the theme the caller handed in, and the cost source naming a
segment is escaped into both, having arrived off the sink.
