"""The page a render pass is driven against, and what it draws onto.

Streamlit lives in the optional `dashboard` dependency group, so the render
cases hand a page stand-in recording the markup written into it. The chrome
goes into two slots rather than the page body, so each region is its own
recorder and a case can say which of the three a pass wrote into rather than
only that it wrote.

The theme marks every reading a formatter was handed, so a count reaching the
markup raw can be told from one the page shortened, and the reads are answered
with their own names, so a case can say which read family reached which panel.
