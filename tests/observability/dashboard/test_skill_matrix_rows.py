"""What one cell of the trigger matrix says, and how it is drawn.

The cases lead with the cohort that reached for a skill on none of its runs,
because that cell is the reason the panel pairs a catalog with the triggers at
all: it is toned down rather than dropped, and its denominator is not, since
the cohort's own run total is what the zero is read against. Beside it are the
whole-point rate a busy cell reports, the source level that keeps two
definitions of one name apart, the label an empty category is bucketed under,
and the escaping every naming column arrives needing.
