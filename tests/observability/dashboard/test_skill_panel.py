"""The card a window's skill adoption is reported on.

The cases name what the card decides rather than what the tables under it draw:
which panel the card opens on, the section each adoption cell is folded into
and that no cell falls out of that split, the single notice a window with no
run at all is answered with, the order each table is opened in when the page
URL asked for one, and the caption that qualifies a quiet window. That caption
is the reading with the most to get wrong, so every evidence shape a window
with no adopting session can arrive in is here -- each one proof that tracking
recorded something, and so a window the card must not tell an operator to
switch tracking on for.

A level a window has no cell of is a separate reading from a window with no
cell at all, so both are driven here: the first says only that the level is
empty, the second is the one window the opt-in switch is named for.

Whether the window carried adoption evidence is also what the diagnostics above
are handed, so the two windows that flag separates -- a genuine no-trigger and
one nobody enabled tracking for -- are driven through the card rather than
through the diagnostics directly.
