"""How one page load's two waves are driven, and what a failed one costs.

Streamlit lives in the optional `dashboard` dependency group, so the cases
below hand the load a stand-in that records the spinner it was opened under,
the banner it was asked to show, and the stop that ends the script -- which is
the whole of what this owner reaches Streamlit for. Its readers record
themselves into the same list, so a case can say which reads ran, in which
order, and on which side of the render between the waves, rather than only what
came back.
