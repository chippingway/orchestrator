"""What one issue's trace shows, and the three things it says instead.

Streamlit and pandas are faked so a render runs end-to-end in the default
install: the heading, the notices, the banner, and what is handed to
`st.dataframe` are what an operator sees, and the fake frame is the row list it
was built from, so the columns and their order can be read straight off it. The
scope entry is faked the same way, which is what lets a case say whose read was
issued inside it and under which filters without standing a database up.
