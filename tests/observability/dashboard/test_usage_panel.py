"""What the hero card stacks, and what the toggle above it remembers.

The chart builder is stubbed out, so what a case reads back is the rows, mode,
and title the card asked for rather than a figure. That request is the boundary
worth pinning here: the figure itself belongs to the chart owner, and this card
is what decides which stack that owner is asked to draw.
