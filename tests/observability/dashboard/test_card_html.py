"""What a card, a banner, and a tile look like by the time a browser reads them.

Every case here reads the rendered string the way the stylesheet does: a class
name is what paints a severity or a tone, an icon is what a severity says
without a word for it, and an escaped value is what keeps a repo name or an
issue title off the page as markup rather than as text. The three surfaces are
read the same way because they are one contract -- the class names spelled here
are the ones `css.py` writes rules for.

The two halves a caller may leave out are read from both sides. A card given no
subtitle must not draw an empty line under its title, and a tile handed a value
that already reads as text must not be pushed through the caller's number
formatter, because the same strip is drawn beside counts and percentages.
