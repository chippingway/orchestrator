"""The page surface the hero card is drawn onto, faked.

Streamlit is in the optional `dashboard` group and the card is handed its `st`
rather than reaching for one, so the cases drive a whole render against a
stand-in that records what each call was given. Session state is a plain dict
because that is the whole of what the card asks of it -- read a remembered
mode, write the picked one -- and a rerun is modelled by seeding that dict
before the render rather than by driving two.
