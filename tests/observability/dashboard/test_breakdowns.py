"""Which read a comparison panel is drawn from, and under which key.

An adapter here settles two things and nothing else: the query owner's read a
panel is answered by, and the key that read is issued under. So the cases below
patch the binding both travel through and read back what was handed to it,
rather than standing a database up to observe the same two facts through rows.

The key is built by the filter owner rather than written out here, because what
an adapter owes a page is its own key passed through untouched -- a hand-rolled
tuple would keep passing after the two spellings drifted apart.
