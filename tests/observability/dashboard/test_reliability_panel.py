"""The repository ranking, beside whether the runs behind it held up.

The cases name what the section decides rather than what the two chart
families draw: the split the columns are laid out in, which reading lands in
the wider one, and -- the reading the pairing is bounded by -- the two days the
throughput strip is handed. The page's window is half-open, so the day an
operator's filter closes on is the one before its end, and a case drives a
window whose two ends are seven days apart and reads the bounds straight back
off the builder.

Both builders are the section's own module-scope imports rather than a handle
it is passed, so a recorder stands in for them under `patch.object` on this
owner -- and the page state the render is handed carries no chart handle at
all, which is what says the section reaches the two families directly rather
than through anything the caller threaded down.

The run-health strip is driven for real rather than stubbed, because what the
section decides about it is which readings reach the reduction and whose
formatter renders them: a case builds the same strip off the two owners and
asserts the column carries it.

The Plotly configuration is likewise reached rather than handed, so a case
patches it on the owner that holds it and drives the render, which is what says
the toolbar decision is resolved at call time rather than captured when this
module was imported.
