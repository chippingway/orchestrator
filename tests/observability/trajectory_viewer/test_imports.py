# could disagree over. Some owners report less than they hold because the check
# reads `__module__`, which only a class or a function carries -- `constants` is
# seven strings, `css` one, `usage_html`'s separator another, and
# `timeline_html`'s badge vocabulary a mapping proxy beside a type alias -- and
# because two shapes are private to the page that carries them: the KPI tile on
# `summary_html`, and the two page shapes on `page_models`, which is why that
# owner reports nothing at all.

# The whole chain an import of each owner plants, declared per owner because
# the direction is the point: the two leaves reach nothing, the models name the
# vocabulary a kind is compared against, the two view owners name the models
# they build and return, and only the record names those views. Reaching the
# other way -- a view importing the record its functions are bound onto -- is
# the cycle this rejects, and is why the views name the record at type-check
# time, where no import happens at all: the record is absent from every chain
# but its own and the parse that builds it. The parse sits above the whole
# package for that reason, and nothing here names it back; the read that drives
# it sits above the parse for the same one. `log_paths` is off to the side of
# both: naming the file a read opens costs the vocabulary its banner is spelled
# in and nothing else here. The three filter and summary owners that answer over
# runs name the record at import rather than only at type-check time: their
# annotations are a published surface, so `typing.get_type_hints` on the reads a
# page calls has to resolve them, and a name bound only for a checker resolves
# to nothing at runtime. `filter_models` is the one that names no run at all,
# and it stays the shortest chain here. The rendering owners sit at the far end
# of the same direction: each names what it draws -- the record for `run_html`,
# `timeline_html`, and `usage_html`, the summary for `summary_html` -- and
# nothing names them back, while `css` names nothing in the package at all.
# `usage_html` is the one that also names a sibling renderer: the money on a run
# row and on a turn strip is the exact-cents format the KPI tile is drawn with,
# so it reaches `summary_html` for it rather than spelling a second one. The
# page owners close the same direction off at the top: they name the read, the
# filter, and the markup owners under them and nothing here names them back,
# with `page_render` the widest chain because it is the composition the rest are
# reached through -- the tiles from `summary_html`, the two empty states from
# `page_setup` and `picker`, and everything `picker` in turn composes, which is
# the second-widest for the same reason.
