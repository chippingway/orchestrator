    Hands back the `orchestrator.config` / settings-holder pair the owners
    read through, so a test can assert on the values an environment implies
    and patch one of them for the call it is about to make.

    The holder is reloaded *in place* rather than replaced: every owner
    resolves it by name inside the call, and the suite-wide fixture patches
    the two sink knobs on the object it captured at collection, so a second
    module object would leave half the process reading values nobody set.
    That same fixture restores all six knobs when the test ends, which is what
    keeps one test's environment out of the next one's.
