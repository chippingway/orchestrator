# What each owner answers for, declared rather than discovered so a new public
# name is a deliberate edit: a second way to open a socket, run a SELECT, or
# spell a window filter is a second place the close, the error wrapping, or the
# cleared-multiselect contract could disagree. The dialing owner is the error
# type and the two factories under it, plus the two judgments a caller makes
# about a connection rather than a query; the cache is the scope a thread
# reuses, its teardown, and the entry bookkeeping beneath them; execution is the
# resolved inputs one read carries and the two connection paths a SELECT runs
# through. On the input side, requests is the bind and the two projections a
# family reads back off it, request_models the parts it binds into, filters the
# selection and the builder a clause accumulates in, predicates the one clause
# builder behind the three tables it can be scanned on, and conditions the two
# splices and the exclusion probe. On the result side each family owns the rows
# a page reads back off it -- the time cells, the window frame, the spend
# breakdowns, the run and issue rows plus the accessor behind the trace row's
# `result` alias, and the skill cells. The raw reads are the six public
# entry points under raw_reads, one projection owner per family beneath them,
# the named rows the widest SELECT lists are read back through, and the
# coercions a raw column is narrowed by. The rollup reads are the seven public
# entry points under rollup_reads with one projection owner per read beneath
# them, and the breakdown reads the four under breakdown_reads with one owner
# each beneath them too, plus the cell readings a row from either is narrowed
# by. The skill reads are the three under skill_reads, the aggregate owner
# behind each, the session identity and evidence the adoption one is built on,
# the catalog scan and the level lookup an unclassified load is filled from,
# and the payload coercion, cohort, and ranking all of them share. Constants --
# the rollup view name, the two request field names, the `result` attribute
# name, the filter-option columns, the two sort modes, the terminal throughput
# stages, the token-share fragments, the finished-run condition, the two skill
# row caps, the session column offsets, the summary cast list, and the
# signatures themselves -- are not reported here: the check reads `__module__`,
# which only a class or function carries, which is why the token-share owner
# declares an empty surface.
