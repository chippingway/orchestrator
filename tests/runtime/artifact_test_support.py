"""What an artifact-maintenance test stands in for, and what it does not.

The hold is stood in for wherever the question is what the pass DOES with the
answer -- granted, refused, taken at all -- because how that answer is reached
is held to its own contract in `tests/scheduler/`. The teardown under it is
stood in for the same way, so a runtime test never needs a clone, a remote, or
a checkout to say which repository's candidates went to which client.

The one place both come back is the claim check: the guard the pass is handed
is the live scheduler's own reading, so a test about that runs the real
scheduler and the real pass over a candidate holding no artifacts, which the
claim gate answers before anything on disk or on GitHub is asked about.
