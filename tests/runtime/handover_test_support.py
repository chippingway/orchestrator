"""What a handover race needs: a live scheduler and the real host lock.

Neither can be doubled here. The question is whether this process ever gives
its presence on the host up while it still has work, and the two things that
answer it are the scheduler that holds the work and the `flock` that holds the
host -- a stand-in for either would agree with whichever ordering the test was
written against.

What IS wrapped is the claim, and only to watch it: `WatchedHandover` delegates
to the real presence and records what this process looked like at each edge of
the handover. That is where the answer lives, because both gaps a wrong
ordering leaves are edges rather than states -- the moment the presence goes,
and the moment it comes back.
