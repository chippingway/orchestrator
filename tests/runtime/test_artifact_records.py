"""What one candidate's cleanup record says, and what it may never carry.

One record per candidate the pass decided about -- not one per branch, one per
checkout, or one per deletion step -- so a reader counting them is counting
finished issues considered. The fields are three closed vocabularies and, only
where the reason is about one, a branch this repository itself publishes the
issue under; a checkout path, an issue reference, and a name belonging to some
other spec on a shared clone are all dropped rather than published. Which kind
of artifact a reason is about is what decides that, since the kinds are one
string on a host whose `WORKTREES_DIR` is `orchestrator`: a reason spelled only
on a branch keeps its branch there, one never spelled on a branch publishes
none, and the ones spelled on both drop a subject that is both.

What a sink cannot take is the other half, and it is answered on two levels.
The writer below is silent when it is turned off and reports a filesystem that
refused the line on its own channel; what reaches this owner is a record it
could not build, and that costs one line and leaves every candidate behind it
with its own.
