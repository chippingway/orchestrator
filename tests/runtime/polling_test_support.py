"""Shared fakes for the polling runtime and the composition point above it.

The recorders stand in for the two collaborators a polling pass calls out to --
the `GitHubClient` constructor `startup.connect_clients` names, and the
`workflow.tick` each repository's turn ends at -- so a test can drive a run and
then assert on what it dispatched. A pass fans out across worker threads, so
every recorder guards its own bookkeeping with a lock.
