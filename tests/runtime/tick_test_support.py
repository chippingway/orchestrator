"""Reusable execution boundary for polling-pass tests.

Every pass here runs against a real `IssueScheduler` -- the caps and the
in-flight bookkeeping are half of what a pass is asserted on -- with the engine
behind `workflow.tick` and the analytics prune standing in for their owners.
The prune is intercepted on every path, not only where a test asserts on it,
so a pass never rewrites the operator's sink.
