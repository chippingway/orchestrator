"""The record a parsed trajectory line becomes, and what it answers with.

Everything stored here is what the sink wrote: the identity of the run, the
text on both sides of it, the normalized steps, and the usage the provider
reported. Everything computed off it is a projection the two sibling owners
define, bound on as properties so a caller reads ``run.timeline`` or
``run.cost_usd`` rather than calling a helper with the run in hand -- the shape
the page and the filters were written against.

Binding them here rather than defining them here is what keeps the record a
data class: the run is frozen, so a view that reads several fields cannot leave
a half-updated one behind it, and the turn index is cached because a page walks
a timeline entry at a time and each entry asks for its own turn's usage.
