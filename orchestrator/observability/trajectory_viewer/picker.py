"""How an operator gets from a whole read down to the one run they want.

Two surfaces over the same narrowed set, and they answer different questions.
The overview table answers "which run do I want", so it is capped at the most
recent rows a page can be read at a glance -- and it says so, naming how many
matched, because a silently truncated table reads as a complete one. The
picker answers "that one", and it is deliberately *not* capped: it cascades
repository, then issue, then run, so every match stays reachable however long
the list is.

The fixture caption is the toggle's receipt. It is worded for whichever way the
toggle is set, so an operator reading a shorter table than they expected is told
why, and one reading tagged rows is told how to drop them. It is drawn only
where the read actually held fixtures, since there is nothing to explain
otherwise.

Streamlit is the caller's, handed in rather than imported, so this owner stays
loadable in an install carrying no viewer dependencies at all.
