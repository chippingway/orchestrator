"""What one run is identified by on the page, in a tile, a row, and a label.

Three renderings of the same record, each for a different question. The
metadata grid answers "what was this run" once a run is open, and it omits a
field the record never carried rather than drawing an empty tile -- a blank
review round and a review round of zero are different facts. The overview table
answers "which run do I want" across a whole read, in the order the read handed
them over. The picker label is that same choice narrowed to one cohort, where
the repository and issue have already been chosen above it.

A fixture is marked in the two places an operator chooses from: a tagged,
dimmed table row and a prefixed label. The tell itself is the record's own, so
what is decided here is only how it reads.

Every value that reaches the markup is escaped first: a page writes these with
``unsafe_allow_html=True``, and a repository name, a tool name, and a skill
name are all record text this viewer does not own.
