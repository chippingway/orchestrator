"""The shapes one filter request is made of, and the values it is offered.

A request is spelled two ways because both are historical and a caller picks
either: ``RunFilterOptions`` is the object it may be handed as, and
``RunFilterOptionFields`` the keywords the same call may be driven by, field
for field. ``RunFilters`` is what whichever of them arrived becomes once every
multi-value selection has been narrowed to a set and the free-text needle
folded and stripped, so a run is walked against values that were normalized
once for the whole read rather than once per run.

``FilterOptions`` is the other direction: the distinct values a page may offer,
collected off the runs it already read rather than declared, so a dropdown only
ever holds a value some run actually carries.
