"""The one ordered sequence a run renders as, and how it is titled and hidden.

The timeline is what makes two record vintages readable the same way. A record
predating the text-turn steps carries only tool calls and their results, a
newer one interleaves assistant and user turns among them, and both are read
back as the prompt, then the steps in the order they were streamed, then the
final output. Each bracket is dropped when its field is empty, so a run that
was never answered is its prompt alone rather than a trailing blank.

The fixture tells are what an inherited file's synthetic records carry -- the
sentinel prompt the suite writes, the session id its doubles mint, and a run
whose only tool work is loading skills. A stepless record is judged on the
first two alone: "every step is a Skill call" is vacuously true of no steps,
and a real run that recorded none would otherwise be hidden by a toggle an
operator set to drop test data.

The two labels are one string split where a picker needs it: the detail is the
cohort a run is chosen within -- stage, role, backend, review round, timestamp
-- and the label is that detail behind the repository and issue it belongs to,
so the two can never disagree about how a run is named.
