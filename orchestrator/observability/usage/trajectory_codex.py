"""Reconstruct an ordered Codex trajectory from its stream items.

Codex emits several frames per operation -- started, then any updates, then
completed -- so this owner correlates them by `item.id` and keeps each item at
the position its first frame took. `trajectory_codex_items` beside it decides
what each item type contributes, down to which frame's invocation an item is
recorded under; everything here is the correlation, the ordering, and the
frames a stream can carry without an id at all.

The id is what makes an operation one item rather than several, so a wrapper
frame reporting the id of the call nested inside it merges into that call
instead of doubling it -- and, when the wrapper is of a type nothing
normalizes, it neither replaces the normalized pair with a placeholder nor
adds one beside it. Nor does it survive inside one: a placeholder is named
after the wrapper's own type and payloaded with the wrapper's own status, so
the normalized frame replaces it whole rather than merging into it, and an
item the normalized frame reported no invocation for is left with none.

The same correlation is what lets this owner say where every identified item
went. One `SourceItem` per id, in first-seen order, records the disposition
the parser settled on, so a run's steps can be read against the items behind
them: a step-less item is a classification here rather than an id that
quietly stopped existing between the stream and the record. Only the id makes
that accounting possible, so a frame the stream left unidentified contributes
its steps and nothing else -- there is no name to account it under, and every
such frame would otherwise share one.
