"""One issue's events, in the order they happened, at the foot of the page.

Every panel above this one reduces a window to a reading -- a total, a
ranking, a rate -- and the listing beside it reduces one to its rows. This
section is the last narrowing left: a single issue's trace, which is what an
operator opens once a run in that listing raised a question only the sequence
answers -- what ran before it, how long each step took, and where the cost
went.

It is the one read on the page issued outside the cached wrappers, because it
is scoped by more than a cache key carries: those keys are hashed per window
and filter set, and a trace is narrowed to one issue on top of them. It still
enters the shared connection scope, so it runs on the socket the waves above it
opened rather than dialing one of its own.

A repository has to be picked before a number narrows anything. GitHub issue
numbers repeat across repositories, so a trace opened while every repo is
selected would interleave runs that share nothing but a number -- which is why
the section names the control that answers it rather than drawing a trace
nobody can read. The subheading is written before that check, so a number typed
too early still tells the operator which issue the notice is about.

Streamlit and pandas are the caller's, handed in as parameters, so this owner
imports neither and the row projection stays readable without either installed.
