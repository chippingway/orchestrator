"""The compact table the page's hand-rolled panels are drawn as.

Four panels -- the most expensive issues, the aggregate skill-trigger rates,
the per-session adoption matrix, and the invocation-level trigger matrix -- are
inline HTML rather than `st.dataframe`, because each carries an in-row bar, a
status pill, or a sortable header Streamlit's own table cannot draw. They read
as one page only while the type scale, the uppercase header row, the
right-aligned mono numerals, and the hairline row rule are decided once: a
panel restating them drifts from the ones beside it the first time a padding is
nudged. The class name is interpolated rather than fixed so each panel scopes
its own rules, and a caller's extra rules are appended inside the same `<style>`
tag the shared ones are written in, so a panel cannot end up styled by half of
what it asked for.

Beside the markup are the readings a cell is built from: the share of the
widest bar a row is drawn at, the repository name without the owner hosting it,
the zero a missing count reports as, and the dash an amount nobody priced is
rendered with. That last one is the reason they sit here rather than beside the
compact formatters -- a run that cost nothing and a run the parser could not
price are different answers, and a table spelling both `$0.00` would hide the
gap the coverage banner is raised for.

Producing a table costs neither Streamlit nor Plotly, so an importer that never
renders one still loads cleanly.
