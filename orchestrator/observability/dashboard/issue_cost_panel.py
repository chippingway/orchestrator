"""Who a window's spend went to: the costliest issues, and the backends run.

The pair beneath the lifecycle bars answers the other half of the same
question. The left column names the work -- the window's issues ranked by what
they cost -- and the right names the agent that did it, so an operator reading
an expensive issue can see in the same glance whether the backend behind it is
expensive per run or merely busy. The columns are split 7:5 the way the bars
above them are, because a ranked table of repositories and issue numbers needs
the room a stack of single-backend cards does not.

The two columns render different empty states, because they are empty for
different reasons. A window can carry runs the parser could not price, so the
ranking says that no run in it had a recorded cost rather than that nothing
ran; the cards beside it are drawn from `agent_exit` rows directly, so their
absence is the window having no run to report at all.

The coverage bar closes the right column rather than standing on its own,
because it is the qualification on the money the cards above it report: what
share of the window's spend the parser could attribute a price to at all. It is
drawn only when the window carries that split -- a bar with nothing to divide
would claim a coverage reading the window has no rows to support.

Streamlit and the theme are the caller's, handed in as parameters, so this
owner names neither: a page resolves one theme and passes it down, which is
what keeps a card tinted and set the way the chrome around it is.
