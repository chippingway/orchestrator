"""How much of a window's spend was attributed, drawn as one bar.

The bar answers whether the money everywhere else on the page can be trusted:
each segment is one `cost_source` -- what the parser could price, and what it
could not -- and its width is that source's share of the window. Share is read
in tokens whenever the window carries any, because a handful of high-token runs
can dominate spend while looking like a thin slice of the run count; only a
window with no token volume at all falls back to run share, and a window with
neither falls back to a denominator of one so an empty bar renders flat rather
than raising on a page opened to find out why it is empty.

A segment carries both of the strings it appears in -- the slice of the bar and
the entry in the legend beneath it -- because the two share a color and a
percentage, and building them apart is where a legend could start naming a
width the bar above it does not have. The tint comes off the theme the caller
hands in, resolved against the sources present in this window, so the caller's
own palette is what a source is recognized by across both.

Every cost source reaches this owner off the sink rather than out of this
repository, so the name is escaped into the bar's tooltip and the legend line
alike.
