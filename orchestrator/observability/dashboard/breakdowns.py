"""The six panel reads a page's comparison sections are drawn from.

Each one is a window already decided: the page hashed its filters into a cache
key, and what is left to say is which read that key is spent on. So the whole
of an adapter here is a query owner's read named beside the binding that issues
it, and everything under that -- the socket it runs on, the filters the key is
read back as, and the empty answer an unconfigured database yields -- is
decided by the owners it passes through rather than restated per panel.

Each names the query owner that defines it, so a patch aimed at a read lands
where the panel issues it. Which owner that is follows the column a
read groups by: a backend comparison, a per-repository tally, and a daily
resolved/rejected count are all day-bucketed, so they are the rollup's; a cost
source, one run's own token split, and an hour of day are what that bucket
threw away, so they are the breakdown family's.

The activity heatmap is the one adapter carrying a filter of its own. A display
offset changes which weekday-and-hour cell a row is counted into rather than
which rows the window holds, so it travels beside the key instead of inside it
-- which is why it is also the one signature here that is not the key alone.
