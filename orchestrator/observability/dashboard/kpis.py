"""The numbers a window is summarized by, beneath the banners it opens with.

Each is a reduction a headline tile is drawn from rather than a series a chart
is plotted from: how a total moved against the window before it, how that
window's agent runs came out, where its spend went, and how much of that spend
was a second pass over work already done. All four take read-model rows or a
window's own aggregates and hand back plain numbers, strings, and tuples, so
what a tile reports is decided here rather than inside a Streamlit run.

Two of them carry a decision a caller cannot re-derive. The tile triples read
every count off the window's own totals rather than off the capped recent-runs
read, because a window holding more rows than that cap would otherwise report a
failure and timeout count that stops at the newest hundred. The rework share
decides which runs are a second pass by naming the review-round buckets rather
than comparing a round number, because the breakdown that produces them keeps
rounds 3, 4, and 5 apart and groups only 6 and above.

Ordering is the third, and it is total down to the row: issues that tie on cost
fall back to run count and then to the repository and issue number that name
them, and an issue with no recorded cost sorts below every priced one rather
than beside the cheapest. A table redrawn on the same window is the same table,
which is what makes the ranking readable at all.
