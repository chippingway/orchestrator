"""What the page draws between its two read waves, and the load it stages.

A window's panels are read in two waves so the page has something on screen
while the second one is still out. This owner is what fills that gap: the
banner and filter line written back into the slots the controls left, the
banners a window is worth interrupting the page for, and the four-tile strip
every section below is read against.

Which reads each wave is made of belongs to ``read_plan`` and driving the pair
belongs to ``dispatch``; what is decided here is what an operator sees in
between, and the one case where there is nothing more to see. A window whose
first wave reported no event at all has nothing for the panels beneath to draw,
so the chrome is drawn, the empty-window notice takes over, and reporting
nothing back is what ends the load before the second wave is paid for -- which
makes the return value a short circuit rather than only a result.

Every sibling a pass here calls is named directly, so a test intercepting a
render patches the module that holds it and a page and a fix land on the same
object.

Streamlit and the theme are the caller's, carried in the modules shape, so this
owner imports neither and what it assembles stays testable without them.
