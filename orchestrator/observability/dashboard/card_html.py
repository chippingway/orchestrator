"""The markup a card, a banner, and a reliability tile are drawn as.

Every panel on the page is a card, and what makes one is written here rather
than by anything Streamlit draws: the hidden mark the stylesheet selects a
card's container by, together with the title and optional subtitle above it,
the stack of banners the page opens with, and the strip of tiles a window's
run health is read off. The three sit in one owner because each is a string
handed to `st.markdown(unsafe_allow_html=True)` whose class names are the ones
`css.py` writes rules for -- a header spelled in one module and a tile in
another are two places the chrome can stop agreeing with the stylesheet it is
painted by.

What a card is *told* stays elsewhere. A banner arrives as the `insights.py`
shape a crossing is raised as, so this owner decides only the glyph and the
class its severity paints through, and a severity nothing is mapped for falls
back to the neutral one rather than an empty box. A tile arrives already
reduced by `kpis.py`, and the number on it is rendered by the formatter the
caller hands in: the same strip is drawn beside counts and percentages, so a
value that already reads as text passes through untouched and only a numeric
one is formatted.

Every value a caller passes is escaped on the way in. A repo name, a skill, an
issue title, and a severity all reach a card off the sink rather than out of
this repository, and the whole surface here is markup a browser is asked to
interpret.
