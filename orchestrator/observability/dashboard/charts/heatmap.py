"""The weekday-by-hour grid a window's activity rhythm is read off.

One 7x24 figure: a row per weekday, a column per hour, and the token volume
that landed in the cell where the two meet. Volume rather than event count is
what a cell is worth, because counting events would weigh the cheap
`stage_enter` and `stage_evaluation` rows the same as the agent exits that
drive spend, and the hours that looked busiest would be the ones that cost
nothing. `HourlyHeatmapPoint.count` stays on the row for a caller that wants
the count itself.

Postgres `EXTRACT(DOW FROM ts)` numbers Sunday 0, and the rows are drawn in
that order rather than re-mapped, so the row a point lands in is the number the
read handed over. A point naming a cell the grid does not have is dropped
instead of raising: one out-of-range weekday is not worth a page that fails to
load.

The hour axis is annotated with the zone the caller says the cells are already
in. Nothing here shifts a timestamp, so passing `get_hourly_heatmap` the offset
that matches the label is what makes the label true.

Plotly lives in the optional `dashboard` dependency group, so it is imported
inside the call that builds the figure: importing this owner has to work in the
default install, which does not carry it.
