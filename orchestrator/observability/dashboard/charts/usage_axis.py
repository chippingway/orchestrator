"""The two scales a usage figure's stack and its cost line are read off.

Tokens and dollars are orders of magnitude apart, so the stack keeps the left
axis and the cost line rides a secondary one on the right. Both are cut into
the same number of steps and both start at zero, which is what lets a single
horizontal rule mean something on either scale: an axis left at whatever the
busiest day reached would put the cost ticks between the token ticks and the
grid would say two things at once.

A maximum is rounded up to 1, 2, 2.5, 5, or 10 times the decade under the step
it would otherwise take, so an axis is labelled in the numbers an operator
reads off a ruler rather than in a day's arbitrary total. A window with nothing
in it is given a real span anyway, because a range of [0, 0] draws no gridlines
to read the empty state against.

The token axis is scaled to the stack the figure actually draws, which is why
the mode and the per-backend rows travel this far down: measuring the token
bands under a per-backend stack would leave the tallest band drawn past the top
of its own axis.
