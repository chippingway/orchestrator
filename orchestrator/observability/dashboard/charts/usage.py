"""The hero figure a window's spend and token usage is read off.

One figure carries both: the day's tokens as a stack of bands and the day's
spend as a line over them. They are drawn together because the question the
page is opened with is whether a day's cost tracks the work behind it, and two
panels side by side would make that a comparison across two axes rather than a
reading of one.

Assembly is the whole of what this owner decides. The window is shaped first,
the stack is added in the mode the page asked for, the cost line is overlaid
on the secondary axis, and the layout is merged last -- after the traces,
because the token axis is scaled to the stack that was actually drawn. A
window with nothing behind it never becomes a figure at all: the shared
placeholder answers it instead, at the same pinned height, so an empty hero
panel keeps the slot the drawn one would have taken.

`backend_per_day` is the stub beside it, answering with an empty mapping. No
panel calls it: the per-backend stack takes its rows through
`usage_over_time`'s own parameter, so what this owner publishes under that name
is the shape a per-backend daily aggregate would be read back in.

Plotly lives in the optional `dashboard` dependency group, so it is imported
inside the call that builds the figure: importing this owner has to work in
the default install, which does not carry it.
