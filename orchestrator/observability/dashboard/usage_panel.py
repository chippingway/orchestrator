"""The card the page opens with, and the toggle that decides its stack.

This is the first panel under the KPI strip, so it answers the question the
page is opened with -- whether a day's cost tracks the work behind it -- and
the figure it draws carries both readings at once. What this owner decides is
the card around that figure: the header naming it, the one control an operator
has over it, and the rows the chart is handed for the mode they picked.

The toggle is a two-value radio rather than a checkbox because neither stack is
the drilldown of the other: by token type is what a day's tokens were spent on,
by backend is who spent them, and an operator switches between the two readings
rather than opening one out of the other. The picked mode is kept in the page's
own session state so it survives the rerun Streamlit performs on every
interaction -- a filter change would otherwise snap the hero card back to the
default stack while every panel below it kept the window the operator asked
for. The radio is seeded from that remembered mode by index, since Streamlit
takes the option's position rather than its value.

The per-backend rows are totalled here rather than read that way, because the
same `(day, backend)` cell can arrive more than once and a stack drawn off the
raw rows would show only the last of them. They are totalled only when the
backend stack is the one being drawn: the token-type stack is already carried
by the time-series points, so accumulating a window's backend rows for it would
be work no trace uses.

The header, the figure, and the Plotly defaults all come off their owners
directly, so what this card is titled by, drawn as, and configured with are the
same objects every other panel on the page uses. Streamlit is the caller's,
handed in as a parameter, and the figure builder reaches Plotly inside its own
call, so importing this owner costs neither.
