"""The connection one replay runs on, and the rollup it leaves refreshed.

psycopg is named inside the two factories rather than at module scope: the
driver is pinned in `pyproject.toml`, but an operator who has not deployed
Postgres must still be able to import anything that reaches this package, so
the load path stays driver-free and the ImportError only surfaces on a sync
that actually dials. Both factories are defaults a caller may replace, which is
what lets a test drive the whole run over an in-memory double.

Everything else here is cleanup that must not turn a successful sync into a
failed one. A rollback that itself raises, a close that raises after the rows
are already durable, and a materialized-view refresh that fails on a
pre-migration deployment are each logged and swallowed -- the operator's log is
where they surface, and the next sync's refresh is what recovers the rollup.

    populated and does not lock the events table; it does take an
    `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the view itself for the duration of
    the rebuild, which is fine for the operator-driven sync (the
    dashboard re-reads on a 60-second cache and tolerates a brief
