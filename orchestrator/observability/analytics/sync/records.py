"""What one JSONL record hashes to, and which of its fields the table names.

The hash is the dedup key the INSERT arbitrates on, so its encoding is pinned
to the one the sink wrote the line with rather than chosen here. The parse
beside it answers a narrower question than validation: every required field
either narrows to the type its column is declared as or the whole record is
refused, because a row the table would reject is cheaper to skip than to send.
