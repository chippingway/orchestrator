"""One JSONL file streamed into one open connection, a batch at a time.

Two dedup filters stand between a line and the wire, and they answer different
questions. A startup scan pulls every persisted `content_hash` into a Python
set, so a record the database already holds is skipped before it costs a
round-trip, and a hash queued earlier in this same file joins that set as the
loop runs -- which is what makes two identical lines cost one insert rather
than two. `ON CONFLICT (content_hash) DO NOTHING` in the statement stays the
authoritative backstop underneath both, because a concurrent writer can land a
row after the scan has already answered.

What reaches the wire is batched: one `executemany` per full buffer collapses N
round-trips into one pipeline, and the driver's per-batch rowcount is what
splits it back into inserted and duplicate. A malformed line is counted and
logged rather than raised, and a blank one is neither, so a single bad line in
a rotated file never aborts the replay of the thousands after it.
