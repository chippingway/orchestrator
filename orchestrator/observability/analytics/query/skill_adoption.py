"""How many sessions that could have used a skill actually did.

The denominator is what separates this read from the matrix beside it. A
matrix cell counts runs against the runs of its cohort; an adoption cell counts
*sessions that were offered a skill* against the ones that loaded it, so a
skill offered to two sessions and used by one reads 50% no matter how many
times either session ran. Both are needed because a busy session repeating one
skill and many sessions each reaching for it once look identical by run count.

A cell carries its window diagnostics beside that ratio rather than folding
them in. `invocations` is the cohort's whole run count, `load_rows` the window
runs that loaded the skill, and `incidental` the ones that only referenced it
in passing -- a path mentioned, not a skill read. None of the three moves the
adoption ratio; they exist so a cell showing one adopting session out of forty
can be read as either a quiet skill or a busy one nobody keeps using.

A cell is keyed by the skill's source level as well as its name, so a session
offered a repository's own `develop` and one offered a global skill of that
name are two cells rather than one blended ratio. A record that named no level
-- a claude run, whose stream names no source directory -- is filed at the
level the repository's catalog offers that name at, where it offers exactly
one; the catalog scan behind that lookup is a third read beside the two session
scans, narrowed as the repository-level record it reads requires and documented
on the owner that runs it. The fill reaches every kind of evidence a cell is
built from, because resolving the loads and leaving the offers alone would move
a session out of the denominator it belongs in.

Which cells exist is the union of three observations, not just the availability
set: a purely incidental reference and a load whose session reported a
different availability set each get a row too, so an observation is never
dropped for disagreeing with the denominator it would have been filed under.
Ordering puts the widest reach first -- sessions offered, then sessions
adopting, then the busiest cohort -- so the cap keeps the cells a reader would
have looked at first.
