"""What one workflow stage cost, and how much of that spend was cached.

The rollup stores duration as a sum and a count rather than an average, because
averaging per-day averages would weight a quiet day the same as a busy one; the
row-weighted mean is recovered here as `SUM(sum) / SUM(count)`, and a stage no
row carried a duration for divides by a guarded zero so the answer stays NULL
rather than becoming a zero a panel would render as "instant".

Cost is reported three ways -- the total, and the cache / no-cache split
`cache_shares` weights each bucket by -- so a panel can stack the two bands and
still have them sum back to the total. The `runs` count beside them narrows to
`event = 'agent_exit'` under the same predicate as the totals, so the sub-line
a panel labels "runs" is scoped to the same rows as the cost above it.

Buckets with no stage are excluded, since a row a page has no stage to file
under would land in an unlabelled bar.
