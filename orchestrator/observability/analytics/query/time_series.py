"""One window's volume, spend, and tokens laid out day by day and event.

The rollup is already keyed on the day, so the bucket a chart plots is the
grouping key itself rather than a truncation computed at scan time. Cost and
the four token bands come back on the same cell as the count, which is what
lets the volume, spend, and token charts pivot one result instead of asking
three times for the same window.

Rows come back ascending by day and then by event, so a chart reads its series
left to right and stacks its bands in the same order on every redraw.
