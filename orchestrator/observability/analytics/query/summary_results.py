"""Reading the three tagged branches of one summary query back as a Summary.

The rows arrive interleaved and untyped -- a totals row, one row per event, one
row per stage -- so each branch is picked out by its `kind` tag rather than by
position, and a query that returned no totals row at all still answers with the
breakdowns it did return.

The two breakdowns are ranked here rather than in SQL: count descending with
the label breaking ties, so redrawing the same window cannot reshuffle a table,
and the insertion order of the returned mapping is the order a page iterates.

The totals row is mapped column-by-column through a declared cast list rather
than unpacked, which is what lets a shorter row -- a fixture or a caller that
predates a column -- leave the trailing fields at their model defaults instead
of raising.
