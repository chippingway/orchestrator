"""How often a role-and-backend cohort loaded any skill at all.

The coarsest of the three skill reads: one row per `(agent_role, backend)`, and
no skill name anywhere in it. What it answers is whether a cohort reaches for
skills, which is why the denominator is every finished run rather than the runs
that loaded something -- a cohort that never triggers is a real zero rate, not
an absent row, and dropping it would hide exactly the case the panel exists to
surface.

Two counters ride beside that denominator because they answer different
questions. `skill_runs` tests the `skills_triggered` key for presence, so it
counts the runs that loaded at least one skill; `total_triggers` sums the
recorded count, so a run that loaded three contributes three. The presence test
is a key probe rather than a non-empty check, so a run that recorded an empty
load list still reads as a run that reported.

The scan stays on the events table: the `extras` blob these fields live in is
not carried by the day-bucketed rollup, and the caller's own event selection is
dropped from the window before the finished-run condition is spliced in, since
a selection naming other events would contradict the pin.
