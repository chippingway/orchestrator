"""Named query-boundary rows for wide analytics SELECT lists.

A fifteen-column unpack read by index is a contract nobody can check by eye, so
the three widest SELECT lists are read back by field name instead: the row
names line up with the SELECT list, and a column inserted in the wrong place
fails on a name rather than silently shifting every value after it.

The two padded constructors carry the other half of that: a fixture written
against an older, shorter SELECT list still builds a full row, with the columns
it never carried reading as NULL, so the projections above them keep their
zero- and `None`-defaulting behavior.
