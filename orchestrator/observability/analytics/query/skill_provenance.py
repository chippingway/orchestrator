"""What a repository offers a skill at, and the blank level that fills from it.

A run reports the skills it loaded, but not always the level each was defined
at: a claude stream names the skills it pulled without naming a source
directory for any of them, so every one of its loads arrives unclassified.
Read against the name alone that load becomes a cell of its own -- a
`develop` at `unknown` sitting beside the `develop` at `project` a classifying
record put there -- and one definition's use is split across two rows that
neither add up nor read as the same skill.

`repo_skill_catalog` is what closes that gap, because it enumerates a
repository's own checked-in definitions and the level each was classified at. A
name that repository offers at exactly one level has one definition an
unclassified load could have come from, so the load is filed there. Anything
less certain is left where it is: a name the catalog never offered, or one it
offers at two levels, stays `unknown` rather than being guessed into a cell it
may not belong to. The lookup is per repository, so a level another repository
classified a same-named skill at never reaches this one's runs.

What a run did record is never overwritten. An explicit level is an observation
from the run itself and outranks the repository-wide inference, so a globally
installed `develop` a run named `user` keeps that level even where the
repository checks in a `develop` of its own.

Both per-skill reads resolve here, and each resolves every category of evidence
it gathers: the loads a trigger cell counts, and the window loads, the
incidental references, and the historical offers and loads an adoption cell
reads a session across. Resolving one category and not another is what would
leave a session offered a `develop` it is never credited with loading, so the
rule has to reach all of them or none.

The scan behind all of this is filtered differently from the run scans beside
it. A catalog record is a repository-level fact -- no issue, no stage, and
written whenever the catalog was last scanned -- so pushing the window, issue,
or stage selection onto it would drop every catalog row and leave both the
padding and the resolution with nothing to read. A catalog name the record left
unclassified is offered at `project` rather than at the `unknown` an
unclassified run row reads: this scan enumerates a repository's own checked-in
definitions, so what it offers is a project definition even when the record
classified none.
