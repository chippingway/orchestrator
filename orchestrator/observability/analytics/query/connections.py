"""How a read reaches the operator's Postgres target, and what a failure is.

`AnalyticsReadError` is the single exception every read wraps a driver failure
in, with the original preserved as `__cause__` so a caller can log or
introspect it without this package re-exporting psycopg's hierarchy. Under it
sit the two connect factories the read path defaults to, differing only in
whether the socket they open is meant to outlive the query: `default_connect`
for the open-per-query path, `default_persistent_connect` for the one a thread
keeps.

Both defer the psycopg import to call time, so importing a read model never
costs the driver -- `pyproject.toml` pins `psycopg[binary]`, but a caller that
only consumes the dataclasses (typing, tests, docs builds) must not meet an
ImportError -- and a test can inject a `connect(db_url)` factory of its own
without installing one.

Beside them are the two judgments a caller makes about a connection rather than
about a query: whether closing it failed, which is logged and swallowed because
the rows already came back, and whether an escaped error means the socket
itself is gone.
