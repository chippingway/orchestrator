"""One aggregate row per issue in a window, and the two orders it comes in.

The two orderings are what the same table is read as: "what moved recently"
and "what cost the most". Ranking by cost has to happen in SQL, because
ordering in Python after a `last_seen`-bounded `LIMIT` would silently drop the
older high-cost issues the cost view exists to surface. Either ordering breaks
ties on `(last_seen, repo, issue)` so a redraw of the same window returns the
same page, and the cost order sorts NULLs last so an issue with no priced run
never outranks one with a measured spend.

Aggregated off `analytics_events` rather than the daily rollup: the per-row
`ts` precision behind `first_seen` / `last_seen`, the latest non-null stage,
and the review-round and retry maxima are all detail the rollup does not carry.
