"""The cell a skill fact is filed under, and the payload it is read from.

A skill fact is not a column. It rides in the `extras` JSONB blob of an
`agent_exit` row, so every reader here starts from a value a driver may hand
back three ways -- an adapted Python object, the raw JSON text, or nothing at
all because the key was never written. A name array collapses to a list of
strings and a name-to-level map to a dict of them, with a malformed blob
collapsing to an empty one rather than raising, because one bad `extras`
payload must not take a whole window's aggregate down with it.

A skill is identified by its name *and* the source level that defined it, so
the `develop` a repository checked in and the `develop` an operator installed
globally stay two cells rather than one blended average. A level is read off
the same row that named the skill, and a name the row's level map does not
cover reads `unknown` -- a record written before levels existed, or a claude
run whose stream names no source directory for the skills it lists, lands
under one spelling an operator can look up instead of a scattering of blanks.

The cohort is the other half. Every skill read groups by the same
`(repo, agent_role, backend)` triple, with a missing role or backend reading as
`unknown` rather than being dropped -- a run that recorded neither is still a
run the cohort's denominator counts. One cell type carries that triple, the
skill inside it, and the skill's level, so the two aggregates and the orderings
over them read a named field rather than each remembering the position a bare
tuple put it at.
