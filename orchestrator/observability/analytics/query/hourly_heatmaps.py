"""When the work happened, as a weekday-by-hour cell in the chosen zone.

The hour of day is the one thing the day-bucketed rollup rounded away, so these
cells are counted off the events table itself. The offset a caller picks is
bound as a parameter and never spliced into the text, and `ts` is normalized to
UTC before that offset is added: a database session whose own timezone is not
UTC would otherwise shift every bucket a second time and quietly re-label which
hours were busy.

Each cell carries the token volume beside the event count so a page can render
intensity by spend, which is what keeps the many cheap stage rows from
outweighing the few agent runs that actually cost the money.
