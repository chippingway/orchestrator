"""The cells a skill's reach is reported in, and the share each one derives.

Every row here pairs a numerator with the cohort it is read against, and
derives the share itself rather than leaving three pages to divide -- each
guarded against a zero denominator, so a cell that exists only for its
diagnostics still renders. The floor they share is the same one the recorder
writes under: with `TRACK_SKILL_TRIGGERS` off no skill keys are written at all,
so a `0` here cannot separate a quiet cohort from an untracked one.

The two per-skill cells carry the source level they were filed under beside the
skill itself. The `unknown` an unclassified one falls back to is spelled
literally here rather than shared with the readers that resolve it, because a
result model is a plain dataclass a page imports without paying for the query
owners behind it.

    Powers the dashboard's opt-in per-skill trigger matrix.
    `get_skill_trigger_matrix` combines the repo's `repo_skill_catalog`
    records (the universe of skills a repo offers, from the
    `skills_available` array) with the filtered `agent_exit` rows (the
    runs that actually fired a skill, from the `skills_triggered` array)
    -- both live in `analytics_events.extras` JSONB, so the reader scans
    the base table with no DDL and no rollup change.

    `skill_runs` counts how many runs in the cell *contained* the skill
    (one per run per distinct name in its `skills_triggered` list), not
    the total number of invocations -- a run that pulled `develop` three
    times still weighs one here. A cell with `skill_runs == 0` is a real
    "offered but never triggered" signal: the skill is in the repo's
    catalog and the `(agent_role, backend)` cohort ran in the window,
    but no such run reached for it (e.g. `developer / claude / review =
    0`). When the catalog records are missing the matrix degrades to
    just the observed-trigger cells -- no zero rows are invented.

    `runs` is the total number of `agent_exit` runs in the cell's
    `(repo, agent_role, backend)` cohort (every run, whether or not it
    fired this skill), so a low `skill_runs` reads against the cohort
    size rather than in a vacuum. It is always `>= skill_runs` and,
    because a cell only exists for a cohort that actually ran, always
    `>= 1`. This mirrors `SkillTriggerRateRow.runs` / `.skill_runs`.

    `level` is the source level the skill was defined at (`project` /
    `user` / `harness`), read from the recorded name-to-level map -- so a
    name a repository checked in and a same-named one installed globally
    are two cells rather than one blended average. A catalog-padded cell
    the record left unclassified is `project`, since that scan enumerates
    a repository's own definitions. A run that recorded no level for a
    skill it loaded (a legacy record, or a claude run whose stream names
    no source directory) is filed at the level that repository's catalog
    offers the name at, where it offers exactly one -- so the load counts
    inside the padded cell for that definition rather than beside it. A
    name the catalog never offered, or one it offers at two levels, stays
    `unknown`.

    `agent_role` / `backend` bucket NULLs under `"unknown"` so a cohort
    is never silently dropped. The same `TRACK_SKILL_TRIGGERS`-off

    tracked-but-quiet run from one whose tracking was off.

class SkillAdoptionRow:
    """One `(repo, skill, level, agent_role, backend)` cell of skill
    adoption aggregated by logical agent session rather than by raw run.

    Powers the dashboard's opt-in per-session skill-adoption view.
    `get_skill_adoption` first identifies each logical session from the
    `agent_exit` rows in the reporting window -- keyed by
    `resume_session_id`, then `session_id`, then a per-row fallback so an
    ID-less row is its own session -- and then reads that session's
    availability and load evidence from every `agent_exit` row before the
    window end (ignoring the window start and the stage filter, so a load
    from a prior stage or from before the window still counts, while a
    later load cannot leak backward). A third scan reads each repository's
    `repo_skill_catalog` records, which is what an unclassified level is
    filled from. All the skill fields live in `analytics_events.extras`
    JSONB, so the reader scans the base table with no DDL and no rollup
    change, mirroring `SkillTriggerMatrixRow`.

    `sessions` is the denominator: how many logical sessions in the
    cohort had this skill *available* -- its `skills_available` set listed
    the skill, or, for a legacy load recorded before availability metadata
    existed, the skill was loaded while the session's `skills_available`
    key was absent entirely (an explicit empty set counts as metadata, so
    it does not imply availability). `adopted` is the numerator: how many
    of those sessions actually loaded the skill, counted once per session
    no matter how many runs reached for it. `adoption_rate` is
    `adopted / sessions`.

    `invocations`, `load_rows`, and `incidental` are explicitly
    window-scoped diagnostics -- they count only the reporting-window
    `agent_exit` rows, not the historical evidence. `invocations` is the
    cohort's window run count: every `(repo, agent_role, backend)` run in
    the window, whether or not it loaded this skill, so a low `load_rows`
    reads against the cohort's run volume (mirroring
    `SkillTriggerMatrixRow.runs`). `load_rows` counts the window runs that
    loaded the skill (one per run per distinct loaded name); `incidental`
    counts the window runs that referenced the skill's `SKILL.md` without
    loading it.

    `level` is the source level the skill was defined at, read from the
    recorded name-to-level map, so a session offered a repository's own
    `develop` and one offered a global skill of that name are counted apart
    rather than averaged together. A record that named no level -- one written
    before levels existed, or a claude run whose stream names no source
    directory -- is filed at the level that repository's `repo_skill_catalog`
    offers the name at, where it offers exactly one, so an availability
    report, a load, and an incidental reference of the same definition all
    reach the same cell instead of splitting an `unknown` row off beside it. A
    name the catalog never offered, or one it offers at two levels, stays
    `unknown`, and a level the record itself carried is never overwritten.

    `agent_role` / `backend` bucket NULLs under `"unknown"` so a cohort is
    never silently dropped. The same `TRACK_SKILL_TRIGGERS`-off caveat as
    `SkillTriggerRateRow` applies: with tracking off no skill keys are
    written, so a quiet cohort and an untracked one are indistinguishable.
