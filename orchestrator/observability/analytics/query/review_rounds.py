"""How one window's spend divides across the review rounds it took.

The bucket is a label rather than a number, because the axis a panel plots has
to hold three things a round count cannot. A developer run still in
`implementing` has not been through review yet, so its missing round reads as
round zero; every other missing one reads as `unknown` rather than being folded
in beside it, since "not reviewed yet" and "never recorded" are different
answers. And everything from the sixth round up collapses into one `6+` bucket,
so a rare twelve-round issue cannot stretch the axis for the rest.

Each bucket reports its runs and cost three ways -- the total, and the
developer and reviewer halves -- with each half split into the cache and
no-cache bands `cache_shares` weights it by, so a panel can stack the two roles
or the two bands and have either pair sum back to the total. The scan narrows
to those two roles, because a decomposer or question run has no review round to
file under and would land in a bucket the chart has no bar for.
