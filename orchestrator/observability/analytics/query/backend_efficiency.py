"""How each agent backend performed across one window's runs.

Only finished runs count, so `event = 'agent_exit'` is spliced into the clause
rather than left to the caller's event selection -- and the caller's own event
filter is dropped from the window first, because a selection naming other
events would otherwise contradict the pinned one and leave the scan nothing to
match.

A run whose backend was never recorded still happened, so a NULL buckets under
`"unknown"` rather than vanishing from the comparison. The row-weighted mean
duration is recovered from the rollup's duration sum and count, and stays NULL
when nothing in the window carried one, so a page can hide the column instead
of showing a zero it would read as "instant". Ties on run count break on the
backend label so redrawing the same window returns the same order.
