"""What one run, one issue, or one traced event is reported as.

These rows are positional unpacks of a SELECT list, so the field order here is
half of a contract whose other half is the query that fills it -- a column
added to one without the other silently shifts every field after it. The trace
row also carries the `result` name the page reads an event outcome by: the
field is stored under `event_result` because a bare `result` is a name the
style guide rejects, and the alias is installed as a property so the two can
never hold different values.

    `count` is `COUNT(*)` over every `analytics_events` row that
    carries the stage (so it includes `stage_enter` and
    `stage_evaluation` rows alongside `agent_exit`); `runs` narrows
    to the `event = 'agent_exit'` subset so the redesigned
    dashboard's "Cost by workflow stage" panel can label its
    sub-line as "runs" -- the standalone mock aggregates from
    per-agent-run records, not per-event rows.

    `avg_duration_s` is None when no row in the window had a
    non-null `duration_s` for that stage; the SQL `AVG(...)` returns
    NULL in that case rather than 0 so the dashboard can hide the
    column instead of showing a misleading zero. `total_cost_usd` /
    `total_input_tokens` / `total_output_tokens` roll up the cost /
    token figures across the stage so the breakdown table can plot
    "where the spend went". `cache_cost_usd` and `no_cache_cost_usd`
    split `total_cost_usd` into the portion attributable to cached /
    cache-read / cache-write tokens vs the portion attributable to
    input + output tokens. The split is prorated per rollup row by
    token share so cache + no-cache sums back to the stage's total
    cost, letting the dashboard chart stack cache vs no-cache spend
    per stage. Zero-defaulted so a fake fixture without the run /
    cost / token / cache-split columns still round-trips.
