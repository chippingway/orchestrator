"""The four reads whose grouping key the day-bucketed rollup threw away.

Each one binds its keyword call against the signature its family is declared
with, resolves the connection behind it, and hands the filtered window to the
projection owner beside it. Every signature is a shared one re-annotated with
what the read returns, so the vocabulary a caller writes stays declared once
while the return type stays readable on the function it belongs to.

The column the rollup does not carry is what these four have in common. A
review round, a cost source, and one run's own token split are per-run facts
the day bucket aggregated away, so those three scan the agent-run view; an hour
of day is what that bucket rounded off, so the heatmap stays on the events
table beneath it.

Two answers are decided here rather than in SQL. A database that is not
configured -- and no caller-owned connection to fall back on -- yields an empty
list rather than an error, because "not wired up yet" is a page state and not a
failure. And the agent-run view has no `event` column to push a selection into,
so the three reads on it return nothing without dialing when the selection
excludes `agent_exit`: the filter baked into the view could never match. The
heatmap scans the events table, where that selection becomes an ordinary
predicate, so no short circuit applies to it.
