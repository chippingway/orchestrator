"""How much of the window's spend the price tables could actually account for.

Runs are grouped by where their cost came from, and the buckets are the usage
parser's own verdicts. `unknown-price` -- a model the price tables carry no
entry for -- is the one this read exists to surface, so it is never folded into
the `unknown` bucket a run with no recorded source falls to: one says a price
is missing and the other says a run is, and only the first is a table to
extend.

Each bucket carries the token volume beside the run count, because a source
covering few runs but most of the tokens is the one worth pricing first.
