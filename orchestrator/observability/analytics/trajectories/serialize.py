"""Trajectory usage, turn, item-accounting, step, and record serialization.

One owner for the shape an `agent_trajectory` record has: which run metadata
rides along, which free-text fields are sanitized on the way in, and the order
the variable arrays are charged to the record budget in. The budget order is
part of the shape -- the per-turn array and the source item accounting are
drawn down before the steps, so a run with thousands of turns and no steps is
bounded the same way a run with thousands of steps is, and the accounting a
truncated timeline is audited against outlives the steps it accounts for.

The caps are snapshotted from the `models` owner once per record, so a value
patched between two writes bounds the second one, and the envelope is the
shared `sink` owner's -- the shape a trajectory record has in common with
every other analytics record is decided in one place.

    `prompt` becomes the redacted `user_input`; `system_prompt`, each
    step's content, and the final `output` are redacted the same way.
    `metrics` (the same `UsageMetrics` the baseline `agent_exit` record
    already carries) is denormalized into a `run_usage` summary so the
    file-only viewer needs no re-parse; it is `UsageMetrics.to_dict()` minus
    `backend` (already a record field). Its token counts / cost / model name
    are not secret-shaped, so they skip redaction. The claude per-turn
    breakdown rides along as `turns` (empty on codex, whose usage frames are
    cumulative -- `build_record` then drops the key).

    The parser's per-item accounting rides along as `source_items` (codex-only
    today), one `{item_id, item_type, disposition}` row per item the stream
    identified, in first-seen order. It carries provider-assigned ids and item
    type names rather than agent-sourced content, so like `tools` and a step's
    `name` it skips redaction; everything an item actually said is in the step
    it contributed, and is redacted there.

    Each step is charged its full *serialized* size -- the JSON metadata
    (`kind` / `name` / `tool_id` / `turn`) plus its truncated content, not
    merely `len(content)` -- so steps with empty or tiny content still consume
    the budget. The per-turn `turns` array and the `source_items` accounting
    are charged and truncated the same way (a run with thousands of turns and
    no steps would otherwise write the whole array in full and blow the
    budget); both are drawn down before the steps, so once the running total
    crosses the record budget the remaining turns -- then accounting rows,
    then steps -- are dropped and `truncated` is set. Only the two small fixed
    summaries are always kept whole: `run_usage`, and the
    `source_item_counts` that state how many items were identified and how
    they were disposed of however few of their ids survived. A dropped
    accounting row also sets `source_items_truncated`, so a prefix of the ids
    is never readable as the whole set. `build_record` drops every
    `None`-valued field, so an absent prompt, empty system prompt, no-trigger
    skill set, codex's empty per-turn array, or a claude run's absent item
    accounting leaves its key off rather than storing a null.
