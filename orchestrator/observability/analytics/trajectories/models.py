"""What one trajectory record keeps whole, and the sizes it is kept within.

One owner for everything a record is measured against: the always-retained
headline charged before any variable array, the running total those arrays are
drawn from and the prefix of one that fits it, and the three caps the whole
thing is bounded by -- the per-field head and tail a single value is truncated
to, and the serialized byte budget one record may not exceed.

The caps are defaults rather than environment knobs, so they are declared here
rather than parsed, and this is where a caller shrinks one to bound a run it
is about to record. ``current_limits`` reads all three at the moment a record
is built, so a value patched between two records bounds the second one.
