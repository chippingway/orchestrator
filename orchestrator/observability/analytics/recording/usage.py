"""Usage parsing for one completed tracked agent run.

The token and cost half of an `agent_exit`: what the provider's stdout is
metered into, and the one boundary where a stream the parser cannot read
cancels the record instead of degrading it. The parsed metrics are also
attached back onto the result the caller still holds, which is what lets the
per-issue meter fold the same object the record was built from.
