"""The event families a run appends to the analytics sink.

One owner for the analytics JSONL's own append and the three producer-facing
recorders that reach it directly -- a stage entered, a stage evaluated, and a
repo's skill catalog scanned. They sit together because they are one
vocabulary: an event name, the envelope it satisfies, and the extras it adds
are decided in the same place a reader looks for the shape a record has. The
fourth family, a tracked agent run's exit, composes four steps before it
writes and owns them on ``agent_exit`` beside this module, which reaches back
here for the append. The envelope and the log channel are the shared ``sink``
owner's, because the trajectory sink satisfies the same envelope and reports
on the same channel; they are republished here as the import site a producer
already names.

Where the file is and whether it exists at all is answered by the ``config``
owner above this package, read off the ``settings`` holder beside it inside
the call. Each recorder dispatches its own ``append_record`` on this module,
which is what makes ``patch.object(events, "append_record", ...)`` intercept
an internal append.

This is the bottom of the recording graph: it names ``config``, ``sink``, and
``models``, and none of its siblings, which is what lets the ``agent_exit``
composition above it reach the append here. Nothing under ``trajectories``
names it -- an ``agent_exit`` composes that write, so those owners take the
envelope and the channel off ``sink`` instead, and the layering check under
``tests/observability/analytics/trajectories/`` rejects the back edge.
