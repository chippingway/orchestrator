"""What a by-age prune reads before it decides to rewrite anything.

The read half of retention, shared by both JSONL sinks: how a record's age is
established, what an unreadable one costs, and the split of a file into the
lines that survive a cutoff and the count that did not. Nothing here opens a
file for writing, so "is this record expired?" is answered in one place no
matter which sink asked.

The answer is deliberately conservative. A line that is not JSON, and a record
whose ``ts`` is missing, not a string, or unparseable, is kept verbatim: a
prune an operator cannot audit afterwards is worse than a file that keeps a few
lines nobody can interpret. A naive ``ts`` is read as UTC to match what the
writer emits.
