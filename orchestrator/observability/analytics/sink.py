"""What the analytics and trajectory sinks share on the way to disk.

One owner for everything the two JSONL files answer the same way: the envelope
every record satisfies, the encoding and locking discipline one line reaches
disk under, the fail-open answer to a filesystem that refuses the write, and
the channel a refusal is reported on. They sit together because a reader
asking "what shape does a record have and how does it get written" has one
place to look, and because the two sinks cannot drift apart on any of it.

*Which* file a record lands in is the caller's, which is why the path arrives
as an argument rather than being read here -- the ``config`` owner beside this
one answers that, and the recording and trajectory packages above it each ask
for their own knob.

Both locks are minted here rather than beside the appends that take them
because a sink is only safe when its append and the retention prune that
rewrites the file under it hold the *same* object. The two stay separate
objects so the two files never serialize against one another.

This owner sits above both packages and imports nothing from either. That is
what keeps the recording graph free of a back edge: an ``agent_exit`` composes
the trajectory write, and the trajectory writers reach the envelope and the
line here rather than back through the recorders that called them.
