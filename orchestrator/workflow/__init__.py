"""The workflow package API: one polling tick, the labels, and the guard.

What a caller outside the tree needs to drive the state machine or reason about
it is named here explicitly and nowhere else: the per-repo tick, the two label
vocabularies a GitHub issue carries, and the transition guard together with the
predicate under it and the exception an illegal write raises. The five past the
tick are the `state` owner's own objects, re-exported rather than rebuilt, so
the graph an out-of-tree caller reads cannot fork from the one every in-tree
caller names on that owner. Everything past this surface belongs to the owner
that defines it -- `workflow/engine/` for the tick's collaborators,
`workflow/stages/` for the per-label handlers -- and is reached by importing
that owner, so a patch aimed at one lands where the call site reads it.

`tick` resolves the engine inside the call. The GitHub and git layers below the
engine import `workflow/state.py` for the label vocabulary they are typed by,
and a submodule import runs this initializer first, so an engine import at
module scope would route those layers straight back into the GitHub and git
modules they are still initializing.
