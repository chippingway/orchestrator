"""What one launch pays before a process exists, and what turns it away.

The ledger beside this owner records what an issue may spend and what it has
already spent; the park beyond it is where an issue with nothing left stops.
This is the one place between the two: the boundary every role in this
repository reaches an agent through, and so the only place a charge can be
taken that no road walks around. A gate written into each spawning handler
instead would be a gate the next handler is added without.

Two durable writes rather than one, because the window between them is the
only thing that can tell a launch that never ran from one that did. `reserved`
says a run is charged and no process has been invoked; `started` says the
invocation is what happens next. Both land BEFORE a process exists, because a
charge taken behind the spawn is one a crash, a timeout, or a shutdown kill
collects for free -- and those are exactly the runs a lifetime ceiling is
there to stop an issue repeating. A tick that dies between the two leaves
`reserved`, and the launch it was taken for runs on that charge rather than
paying twice. A tick that dies anywhere after `started` leaves a run nobody
can prove did not happen, so the next launch pays for itself: read as spent,
the issue loses at most a run it may already have had; read as unspent, a
crash loop is a way to spend a lifetime without ever moving past it.

Which launch a standing charge belongs to is written down with it. The
fingerprint is derived from what a request IS -- the role, the stage, the
backend and the spec behind it, the session it resumes, the round and the
attempt it is -- and never from the prompt it carries, which is rebuilt from a
thread that moves between ticks and would make one launch look like a new one
every poll. So a charge is reused by the launch that took it and by nothing
else.

The writes go to freshly read durable state, and only what this owner touched
comes back. Everything the caller is holding is mid-tick: a reviewer spec
staged ahead of the spawn, a watermark a reply moved, a retry slot charged, a
session id about to be replaced. Those belong to the handler's own single
write, which decides at the END of the run whether they are kept at all, and a
charge that flushed them would publish half a tick as though the run had
already been dispositioned. The re-read is what makes the charge authoritative
against whatever else moved since the tick's own read; the merge is what keeps
the caller's later write from putting the charge back the way it found it.

Nothing is invoked unless the charge landed. An unreadable pinned comment, a
refused write, and an allowance with nothing left all end the same way: no
process, and a result that reads as a run which did not happen -- the answer
every spawning handler in this repository already returns without writing
durable state for. Only the last of the three is a decision about the issue,
so only that one parks it and says so.
