"""Where an issue stops once its lifetime agent-run ledger is spent.

The ledger beside this one answers what an issue may spend and what it has
spent. This owner is what happens when those two meet: the issue stops, a
human is told once, and nothing but a human moves it again. A lifetime total
is spent once and no clock returns it, so unlike the day's spawn budget there
is no window here to elapse: what the park waits for is one bounded command
from a trusted operator (`workflow/engine/run_grant.py`) widening the ceiling
this issue is held to, and nothing else on the thread is an answer to it.

The park is durable so that it can be RECOGNIZED. `awaiting_human` alone is
every stage's park, and a tick reading that flag has no way to tell an issue
waiting on an agent's question from one that has run out of runs for good. So
the reason is written beside it and it is stable: `agent_run_limit` is a wire
string on live issues, and it is what lets the dispatcher hold an exhausted
issue ahead of every stage's own awaiting-human road -- each of which is right
about the park it was written against and wrong about this one. A reply is the
answer to a question an agent asked; it buys no runs an issue has already
spent, and neither does the command that lifts this park -- what that widens
is what the issue may still spend.

What the thread is owed is written down rather than assumed said. The comment
and the write that records it cannot be made one operation, and the two
readings of that gap fail in opposite directions: read as already said, a
refused comment leaves a human waiting on a sentence nothing will ever say;
read as still owed, a write that failed after a post that landed repeats one
comment. So the obligation is durable, the thread is asked before it is
repeated, and what a park says is said once per park rather than once per
tick.

That obligation is scoped to the exhaustion that minted it. The reason under
this park never varies -- there is one way to run out of a lifetime -- so the
reason cannot tell one refusal from another, and the sentence quotes numbers
that can: the allowance in force and the runs spent against it. A record
naming the reading the notice was written for is one a later tick can hold up
against the ledger it reads now, which is what keeps a sentence quoting a
ceiling the issue is no longer held to from being the sentence a human is
finally shown. Same reading, same sentence, kept verbatim: the thread is
searched for exactly the text the park recorded, so a notice reworded between
the post and the write that records it would find nothing and say it twice.

Nothing here decides that an issue is out. The ledger is read by whoever is
about to spend a run, and this owner is handed the reading -- so a park is
taken on the numbers the refusal was actually made on, and the sentence under
it quotes those rather than whatever the setting has become since.

The five audit phases are the same story from outside: what was said first,
what the thread was found to already carry, which ticks the park went on
holding, and how the command beside it ended -- one ceiling wider, or one
request this park could not act on.

The moment the park is TAKEN is a sixth thing, and it is reported somewhere
else: `run_budget.py`'s shared `agent_run_budget` stream, which carries it
beside the charges the same launches paid, on both sinks and with the whole
ledger reading under it. The five phases above are about a notice and a
command; that one is about a lifetime ending, and an operator counts it
against the runs that spent it rather than against the sentences that
explained it.
