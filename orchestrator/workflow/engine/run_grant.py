"""The one command that moves an issue off its spent agent-run ledger.

The park beside this owner is the whole ending of an issue that has spent its
lifetime: no clock returns a run, and every stage road below reads
`awaiting_human` as something else. What is left is a human deciding this
issue is worth more runs than it was allowed, and this is where that decision
is written down.

`/orchestrator add-agent-runs N` is that decision and nothing else. What the
words have to be before any of them read as a request -- a line of their own,
an exact positive count inside the bound -- is settled by
`run_grant_request.py` and handed here as one record that already knows
whether it buys anything. Everything else about the reading is decided here.
It is read only while the park stands, because the park is the only thing it
can lift: on a running issue it would be a ceiling nobody was held to, and on
any other park it would answer a question it was not asked. And it is read
only from a trusted author, because what it buys is agent time on somebody's
word -- the same allowlist every other workflow-driving comment on a public
thread goes through.

What a valid command buys is an allowance of exactly `used + N` -- the runs
already spent plus the ones just granted -- rather than a count added onto
whatever the field said before. Written that way it says the same thing
however often it is read: nothing spends a run while the park stands, so a
tick that dies between the receipt and the write grants the same ceiling again
on the next one rather than a second N on top of it.

Everything else is refused rather than acted on, and refused the same way: the
park stands, the ledger is left exactly where the request found it, and the
thread is told what a request has to say. Both answers carry a marker scoped
to the comment that asked, because a post and the write that consumes what it
answers cannot be made one operation -- so the thread is read before either
sentence is written again, exactly as every other receipt in this repository
is. An untrusted account is answered with nothing at all: a reply is a comment
somebody else's word paid for, and consuming the thread for one would spend
the watermark a trusted operator's command is read against.

Neither ending returns a run. What the ledger has spent is spent, and both
counts stay where they were: this widens what an issue may spend, and there is
nothing here that unspends anything.

Only the ending that moves the ceiling reaches the shared `agent_run_budget`
stream (`run_budget.py`), and only once the write that moves it has landed.
That is the transition an operator is counting: how often a deployment's limit
has to be bought past, and by how much. A refusal moved nothing, so it stays
where it already is -- on the park's own audit stream, beside the phase that
records the receipt it earned.

    rather than leaving the command for the next poll: the run a human paid
    for is the one this issue was stopped for.

    False is every other reading, and the caller holds the tick on all of

    cannot act on (which earns its receipt on the way past), and a thread that
    could not be read at all. Those last two are not symmetric with a grant --
    a park held one poll too long is answered by the next read, while a grant
    handed out on a thread nobody could read buys runs no human asked for.

    The park is asked for again here rather than taken from the caller,

    an issue held on a spent ledger, and read anywhere else the same words
    would clear a park waiting for something they do not say -- or hand a

    ceiling twice.

    Said once per REQUEST rather than once per tick, for the reason the
    refusal beside it is: the acknowledgement and the write that consumes the

    reads the same command again -- and the marker its own receipt carries is

    whose sentence was said, which is the only kind that reaches this -- but a
    record left in a shape nothing can read is one the park it belonged to no
    longer has, and the park is what is ending here.

    The budget stream is told last, after the write that makes the wider
    ceiling durable, and that order is what makes the record a transition. A
    command re-read because a tick died between its receipt and its write is
    a grant that never landed, so the reading it reports is the one that
    finally did; a grant that landed takes its own park down, and nothing
    reaches this owner again to report it twice.
