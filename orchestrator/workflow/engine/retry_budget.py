"""The day's spawn budget an issue has, and the park an empty one leaves.

Every fresh agent spawn on an issue is charged to one per-issue budget --
implementing and decomposing share it, because both spend the same issue's day
of tokens -- and the whole point of a cap is that the issue STOPS when it is
out. Which is why nothing in the gate posts: deciding and telling a human are
two obligations with different failure modes, and an owner holding both has to
answer a refused comment either by failing a spawn it already allowed or by
saying the same sentence again on the next tick, forever.

So the gate answers and the caller acts. `_consume_retry_slot` reads the
accounting, charges an attempt it allows, and hands back what it decided.
Every durable consequence of a refusal -- the park, the stable reason under
it, the stage that ran out, and the sentence the thread is owed -- is staged
into the caller's own pinned state and rides out on the write that caller was
going to make anyway. A refusal writes nothing of its own, so a tick that dies
between the decision and that write leaves the budget exactly as it found it.

What a caller then DOES with a refusal is the one part that is not always its
own. A stage whose park has to carry state this owner never sees -- a live
late generation, its frozen pair, and the hold on the pull request its
candidate stands under -- stages the park itself, so the record and the reason
the record stopped moving land on one write. A stage whose park carries
nothing but the park takes `_charge_or_park` below, which is that same tail
written once rather than copied per stage: charge, stage, write, and say it
once. The gate is untouched either way -- it is the composition that writes,
and it writes before it posts.

The park is durable so that it can be recognized. `park_reason` says
`retry_cap` and `retry_cap_stage` says which stage ran out, which is what lets
a later tick tell an issue waiting on THIS from one waiting on an agent's
question -- and refuse the spawn from the flag rather than by re-deriving the
whole window. It is also what keeps the park exhausted: the 24h window is a
budget window, not a parole hearing, and a notice that asked for a human is
not answered by the clock passing it. While the park stands the window is
never renewed, however old it is. Renewal is one explicit step,
`_grant_continuation`, and what it hands back is a single attempt.

What the thread is owed is written down beside the park rather than assumed
said. The comment and the write that records it cannot be made one operation,
and the two readings of that gap fail in opposite directions: read as already
said, a refused comment leaves a human waiting on a sentence nothing will ever
say; read as still owed, a write that failed after a post that landed repeats
one comment. So the obligation is durable, the thread is asked before it is
repeated, and what a park says is said once per park rather than once per
tick.

The four audit phases are the same story from outside: what was said first,
what the thread was found to already carry, which ticks the park went on
refusing, and when a human bought another attempt.

    A standing retry-cap park is the first thing asked and it refuses on its
    own, ahead of the cap and ahead of the window. What stands there was
    announced as needing a human, and every other way of getting past it is
    something no human answered: the clock passing the window, and an operator
    widening `MAX_RETRIES_PER_DAY` or turning it off entirely -- a setting
    change is not the continuation the notice asked for, and reading it as one

    whatever the cap had become in between -- nothing, once it is turned off,
    or several attempts once it is widened -- and what a human bought is one
    attempt whenever it is taken.
