"""Read a developer report outcome, and only out of a run that completed.

`_report_outcome_of_run` is the reader a stage asks. It refuses a run that
never started, was interrupted, timed out, was refused by its provider, or
exited nonzero before it looks at the message at all, so a partial transcript
or a provider's error text is never read as finished work.
`_parse_report_outcome` is the message half alone.

The message is read more strictly than the verdict markers beside it. A report
block encloses free prose, so its marker lines are uppercase and whole-line as
the prompts spell them, and the outcome is the ONLY use of them: every line
opening on `REPORT:` must be the outcome's own -- the READY/END pair around the
report, or the single VERIFIED line -- outside any code block, and the outcome
must end the message. A marker quoted earlier, a second block, a report whose
own text opens a line on the prefix, a marker line that may render as code, or
a question written after the outcome leaves the message MALFORMED rather than
letting one reading win. So does an `ACK:` line the `messages` reader would
accept, so a caller that asks this reader first never takes one reply as both
an acknowledgement and a report.

A marker line may render as code when it sits four columns in or behind a tab,
where it can be an indented code block, or where `report_fences` finds a code
fence may enclose it.

A VERIFIED location is a `github.com` pull request URL, optionally anchored at
one of its conversation comments, and its revision a lowercase SHA-256 digest.
Parsing establishes their shape, not their truth.
