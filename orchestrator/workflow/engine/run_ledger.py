"""What one issue may spend on agent runs, what it has spent, and on what.

A lifetime total is a different kind of number from the day's spawn budget
beside it. That one is a window: it opens, it fills, and the clock empties it
again, so the fields under it may be dropped and rewritten. This one is spent
once. Nothing returns a run an issue has already taken -- not the next day,
not a park a human answered, not a cancelled cycle, and not an operator moving
the setting -- so the count here is charged upward and never decremented,
never zeroed, and never rolled over. Every one of those would be a way for the
same issue to spend the same ceiling twice.

That is also why the count keeps running while the ceiling is off. An
unlimited setting means nothing turns a run away; it does not mean the runs
stopped happening, and a meter that paused under it would report every issue
that ran while it was off as having spent nothing the moment it came back on.
The setting decides what to DO about the total, so it is read where the total
is judged rather than where it is written.

An issue that predates this ledger has still spent its runs, and they are
recorded -- on the `issue_agent_runs` meter the usage accounting has always
folded onto pinned state. So a count that is missing here starts from that
meter rather than from zero, which is the difference between an in-flight
issue keeping what it has spent and being handed a whole fresh lifetime. The
two meters count the same unit, and this one is the superset of the other:
it charges the launch, so it also holds the runs whose usage never parsed.
The legacy total is therefore a floor as well as a seed, and the count is read
as the larger of the two -- monotonic against both writers rather than against
only its own.

The reservation is what makes the charge safe to take before the spawn. A run
has to be charged BEFORE it is launched -- charged after, it is a run that
crashed, timed out, or was killed mid-flight for free -- and a charge taken
before is a charge that may outlive the launch it was for. So what a launch
holds is written down: `reserved` says the slot is charged and the spawn has
not begun, `started` says the spawn happened. Both are wire strings on live
issues, and the pair is what lets a later tick tell a launch that never ran
from one that did. Nothing settles a reservation by giving the charge back.

Which launch holds it is written down beside the phase, as the fingerprint its
reader hands over. A standing charge is only worth reusing by the launch it
was taken for: read by any other, a charge one road recorded would be spent by
a road that never paid for it, and the ledger would stop being a record of
what each run cost. So the pair is asked together -- charged, and charged for
this -- and a launch that is not the one named pays its own way.

Nothing here decides anything and nothing here posts. This owner answers what
an issue is allowed and what it has spent, as one typed snapshot; what to do
about a ledger with nothing left in it belongs to the reader, which owns the
park, the sentence under it, and the write that carries both.
