"""One tick's issues run across a bounded pool: the plan, and the drain.

`tick.py` decides that a repo's pass runs in-tick under a `parallel_limit`
above 1 and hands the whole of that execution here; the per-repo pass ordering
and the sequential mode stay there. What this owner adds over that mode is the
bound, the partition the bound is measured against, and the isolation each of
the two buckets needs.

The two in-tick modes are not one loop at two widths. This one MUST materialize
the enumeration -- the executor needs the submission count up front to bound
`max_workers` -- and so accepts that an enumeration failure costs the whole
tick, which the next one retries; the sequential mode streams for the opposite
reason, that a partial enumeration must not lose what it already yielded.

The family bucket the partition hands over is submitted as exactly ONE task no
matter how many family-aware issues are pending, so it occupies a single worker
slot and leaves the other `limit - 1` free for fanout. Per-family-issue futures
behind a shared lock would instead let a waiting family future hold a second
slot and starve fanout under a small `limit`.

Every collaborator is named on the owner that defines it: the partition, the
fanout task, and the per-worker refetch on `dispatch.py`, and the closes an
earlier poll is still holding on `observations.py`. A mock aimed at one of them
lands on that owner; one left anywhere else would let the real pass run. The
line an isolated per-issue failure reports on comes from `dispatch.py` for the
same reason -- the isolation points here and on `tick.py` beside it would
otherwise spell one message four ways.
