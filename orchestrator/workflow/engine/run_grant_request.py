"""What `/orchestrator add-agent-runs N` has to say before anything acts on it.

Reading the command and spending on it are two separate questions, and this
owner answers only the first. Nothing here touches a ledger, a park, or a
thread: it turns the words a human wrote into one record that already knows
whether it buys anything, and the owner beside it (`run_grant.py`) decides
what to do about that.

The command is a whole line of its own, and its argument an exact positive
whole number no larger than `MAX_RUNS_PER_COMMAND`, because the number IS the
command: a slip of the keyboard that reads as a thousand runs is not a
decision anybody took. Every other reading buys nothing, and they are all the
same nothing -- separated from a request by the human's own comment, which is
still on the thread right above the answer it earns.

The same grammar answers the drift hash, which is why the bare-command reading
is published beside the rest rather than kept inside. An answered command
hands the SAME tick to the stage the label names, so a hash counting it would
put that handler in front of a body nobody edited and call it changed
requirements -- a developer resumed where a reviewer was owed a round. What is
control is the command ALONE; words beside it are requirements and travel the
drift road that carries them to an agent.

# the deployment, so it does not move when `MAX_AGENT_RUNS_PER_ISSUE` does and

    `added` is None for a request nothing can be bought with, which is the

    takes are handed one record that already knows which of the two it is.

    `consumed` is the last comment of the batch this request was read out of,
