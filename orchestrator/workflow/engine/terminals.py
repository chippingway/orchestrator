"""How an issue stops being worked.

Three conditions end one: the linked PR merged (`done`), the linked PR closed
without merging (`rejected`), and a human closed the issue while its PR is
still open (`rejected` too -- a human stop signal outranks whatever the stage
was about to do). What the three share is the tail, not the condition that
reaches them: each stamps its terminal timestamp, flips to a terminal label,
posts the cumulative usage receipt, and writes pinned state once. That shared
tail is why they sit together -- an arc added beside them inherits the order
rather than reinventing it.

Three entry points reach the arcs, and they differ only in who fetched the PR.
`_drain_review_pr_terminals` serves the stages already holding one --
`in_review`, `fixing`, `resolving_conflict` -- and tries all three arcs against
the PR the caller passes; `pr=None` is a deliberate no-op so `fixing` can hand
over its own fetch failure unchanged.

`_pr_terminal_stops_the_tick` serves the stages that hold no PR at handler
entry -- `implementing`, `documenting`, `validating` -- and decides BOTH
pull-request endings off one fetch of its own. One rather than a helper each,
because two fetches are two moments: a merge landing between them answers open
to the first and merged to the second, which a closed-without-merge arc is
right to ignore, and the stage behind it runs anyway over work that has landed.
`_finalize_if_pr_merged` keeps the single-ending form for the umbrella /
blocked child aggregation, which may not be held on a child whose remote
blinked.

A fetch that FAILS leaves both of those falling through: nothing about a failed
read says which ending, if any, it was hiding, and answered as one every issue
whose remote blinked would stop advancing. `_finalize_if_issue_closed` behind
them is the one that defers the whole tick on its own failed read, so a
transient failure cannot label a merged-PR issue `rejected`. Every entry point
returns True to mean "this tick is over".

The `discussion` stage composes the arcs itself rather than taking an entry
point here, because its third one differs: a closed issue whose plan PR is
still open KEEPS its label -- that label is what the closed-issue sweep finds
it by, and the plan the humans are reading is what decides.
`workflow/stages/discussion/plan_terminal.py` reaches `_finalize_merged_pr` and
`_finalize_rejected_pr` directly for that reason, and
`workflow/stages/discussion/terminal.py` reaches
`_finalize_closed_issue_with_open_pr` for a close with no pull request to poll
at all -- which is the same shape that arc already serves here, a close whose
linked PR is not the thing being decided. It records as fully as
the other two -- the stamp, the `rejected` label, the receipt, one write -- and
differs only in what it has nothing to say about: no event, since there is no
pull request for the payload to name, and no branch cleanup.

Branch cleanup is deliberately outside the shared tail. It runs on the two arcs
where the PR itself is gone and the branch is dead weight, and is withheld on
the open-PR arc so an operator can still reopen or salvage what the closed
issue left behind. That arc emits no `pr_closed_without_merge` for the same
reason -- the PR has not closed yet -- while the closed-issue entry point does
emit one once it confirms the linked PR is closed as well.

The receipt's position in the tail is a contract, not a preference: it is
posted BEFORE the write so its comment id rides the same persisted state and a
later drift or watermark tick reads it as orchestrator-authored.
