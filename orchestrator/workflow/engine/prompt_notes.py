    "nothing keeps running between turns, and a later resume starts a fresh "
    "process. NEVER start a background job (build, test run, Miri, server) "
    "and end your turn intending to check it later: the job dies with your "
    "session and its result will never be seen. Run all builds and tests in "
    "the foreground and wait for them to complete before you commit or reply."

_COMMIT_STYLE_NOTE = (
    "Before committing, run `git log --oneline -20` to see how recent commit "
    "subjects are formatted, and write your subject in the SAME "
    "repository-local style. Mirror whatever subject/prefix convention that "
    "history uses rather than assuming a fixed set of types -- it may be a "
    "`<type>: <subject>` form, or a project-specific prefix such as `event:` "
    "or `career:`; the repo's own recent history is the source of truth. Keep "
    "the subject a single short, imperative line.\n\n"

    "Whenever this task ends in finished work -- with a new commit or without "
    "one -- your final message MUST end with your complete, current completion "
    "report for this issue: what the branch changes and why, how you verified "
    "it, and anything a reviewer should know. Write the whole report every "
    "time rather than only what changed since the last one, because it "
    "supersedes every earlier report. Publishing it on the pull request is "
    "routine orchestrator work that needs no permission: do NOT post or edit "
    "the report yourself, and do NOT ask a human whether or how to publish "
    "it. Never create an empty commit, or any change made only to carry a "
    "report -- a report that needs no repository change is delivered with no "
    "commit at all. The one finished reply without a report is an `ACK:` "
    "line, where this prompt offers one.\n\n"
    "End with EXACTLY one of these two report outcomes:\n\n"
    "1. Report ready for publication. Put the complete report between these "
    "two lines, each alone on its own line and outside any code fence, with "
    "nothing after the closing line:\n\n"
    f"  {_report_models._REPORT_READY_MARKER}\n"
    "  <complete report>\n"
    f"  {_report_models._REPORT_END_MARKER}\n\n"

    "current report is already published on this issue's pull request -- for "
    "example one a human posted or edited -- and you read it during this run. "
    "End with this single line, outside any code fence:\n\n"
    f"  {_report_models._REPORT_VERIFIED_MARKER} <location> <revision>\n\n"
    f"<location> is `{_report_models._PULL_REQUEST_URL_SHAPE}` for the pull "
    "request description, or that URL followed by "
    f"`{_report_models._COMMENT_ANCHOR_SHAPE}` for a comment on it. <revision> "
    f"is `{_report_models._REVISION_PREFIX}` followed by the 64 lowercase hex "
    "digits of the SHA-256 of that report's text exactly as GitHub returns "
    "it. The orchestrator re-reads the location and accepts the outcome only "
    "while its text still matches.\n\n"
    "No other line of your message may start with "
    f"`{_report_models._REPORT_MARKER_PREFIX}`, and a report outcome never "
    "shares a message with an `ACK:` line. A report outcome means the work is "
    "finished: if you have a question, disagree with a request, or could not "
    "finish, emit neither outcome and end with your question for the human "
    "instead."
