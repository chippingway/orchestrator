"""What an agent-run budget transition tells both observability sinks.

The ledger beside this owner records what an issue may spend and what it has
spent; the circuit above it charges a launch, and the command beyond it widens
a ceiling a human decided was too narrow. None of those three can be read back
off an issue afterwards: pinned state carries the counts as they stand right
now, so an operator asking how an issue arrived at them -- which launches were
charged, which was turned away, and when somebody paid for more -- has nothing
to read. This owner is that record.

One event family for all four transitions, because they are one story. A
launch that reserved a run, the same launch reaching a process, the launch
that was refused, and the ceiling a human moved afterwards are the whole
account of one issue's lifetime, and split across four kinds an operator would
have to join four streams to read it. So the family is `agent_run_budget` and
the step is the `phase` on it, which is the same shape the park's own audit
stream beside this one already has.

Both sinks, deliberately. The audit JSONL has to answer offline what the
database answers over the analytics sink -- whether a deployment's ceiling is
turning launches away, how much of a lifetime an ordinary issue actually
spends, and how often a human buys past it -- so one call writes both under
their own envelopes, exactly as the late size gate's records do. Neither write
may change what the workflow does: both sinks already swallow a filesystem
refusal, each write additionally rides its own guard, and a failure on one
side does not skip the other.

Every phase carries the whole reading the transition was made on, rather than
the one field that moved. A record saying a run was charged and nothing else
is one an operator has to join against a setting that may have changed since;
a record carrying the configured ceiling, the allowance actually in force, the
runs spent, and what is left of them is a row that answers on its own. The
allowance and the setting are both reported because they are different facts:
an issue may carry a ceiling of its own -- which is exactly what an operator
grant writes -- and a refusal explained by the deployment's number would name
one this issue was never held to.

What is left of an unlimited allowance is not a number, and this is where that
is said out loud rather than left to a missing field. `remaining` is on every
phase, and under a ceiling that bounds nothing it carries the word rather than
a count: any number written there is one a query could compare against zero
and read as an issue about to stop, and an absent field is one a consumer
cannot tell from a count some writer or replay lost.

A charge is correlated by the charge itself, not by the shape of the launch
that took it. `reservation_id` pairs the bounded head of the circuit's
fingerprint with the count that charge moved, because the fingerprint alone
repeats: it is deliberately stable across ticks so a standing reservation can
be recognized, which means the same shape is charged again every time a launch
that already started comes back. The count goes up once per charge and never
comes down, so the pair names one charge on one issue and names it identically
from both phases of it -- and it names nothing the prompt, the worktree, or
anything else a launch was built out of would give away. It is on the two
phases a reservation exists under and on neither of the others: a refused
launch never took one, and a grant is not a launch at all.

A refusal says which way an allowance ran out, from a closed vocabulary. The
two readings are genuinely different to whoever is looking: an issue that
spent exactly what it was allowed has reached the ordinary end of a lifetime,
while one already past the ceiling in force was carried there by a ceiling
that moved under it -- a narrowed setting, or a deployment that ran with the
limit off. Bounded rather than free text for the reason every field here is:
a sink carries whatever it is handed.

Emission is tied to the DURABLE transition and to nothing else, which is what
keeps the stream a count of things that happened. A charge is recorded after
the write that takes it lands, so a launch honoring a reservation an earlier
tick left standing reports only the start it actually paid for; a park is
recorded by the tick that takes it, so the ticks that go on meeting it say
nothing; and a grant is recorded after the write that widens the ceiling, so a
command re-read because a previous tick died between its receipt and its write
reports the one extension that became durable.
