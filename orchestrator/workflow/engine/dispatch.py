"""How a tick's pollable issues become handler calls.

Everything between "the repo has open issues" and "one `_handle_<stage>` is
running" lives here, because the decisions are one chain and each link is only
safe given the one before it.

The chain starts with the hard-skip filter. `backlog` / `paused` park an issue
outside the state machine entirely, and the filter runs twice on purpose: once
in `_classify_pollable_issue` so a parked issue never reaches the partition,
and once in `_process_issue` so a directly dispatched one is still refused.
Dropping it early is not an optimization -- a parked issue carries no workflow
label, so leaving it in would fold it into the family bucket and flip that
bucket cap-counted, reserving the only per-repo slot under the default
`parallel_limit=1` and starving every fan-out issue behind a hold nobody is
working on.

The partition is the concurrency contract. Family-aware labels (`decomposing`
/ `blocked` / `umbrella`) and the unlabeled-pickup `None` are cross-issue
writers -- a parent's recovery seeds `parent_number` on a child whose own
handler would clobber the same pinned-state comment -- so they collect into one
bucket that drains sequentially, and everything else fans out. A label read
that raises is answered `(False, None)`, which routes that issue into the
family bucket rather than dropping it: the conservative side of an unreadable
label is the serialized one, where `_process_issue`'s per-issue exception
isolation picks up a sustained failure.

Cap exemption is what keeps the serialization from deadlocking. A bucket whose
every label is a no-agent, no-worktree handler (`_CAP_EXEMPT_FAMILY_LABELS`)
skips the per-repo and global caps, because a `blocked` parent polling its own
children would otherwise wait on the only slot those children need to finish.
Closed fan-out issues are exempt for the same reason at the other end: their
handler is a terminal finalize with no spawn, so it must not queue behind
active agent work.

A closed issue on the two cleanup-swept decomposition labels is the one case
where the label does NOT name the handler. `decomposing` and `umbrella` reach
the sweep yielding them only so their generation ledger can be settled, and
handing one to the stage handler its label names would spawn the decomposer on
an issue a human closed, or walk a dependency graph and activate children under
it. So the cleanup route is taken FIRST, ahead of the table and ahead of the
pinned-state guards, and the issue never reaches either.

Past that route, one read of the issue's own pinned comment answers six
questions that can stop the tick outright: a live late adjudication the label
was moved out from under, a child of a split whose snapshot the remote no
longer has, an owner whose cancelled cycle is still holding something on the
remote, the restart an operator authorizes by taking that cycle's `rejected`
back off, an issue that has spent every agent run it is allowed, and an
unlabeled issue that already carries a pinned comment. Most of them are asked
here rather than in a stage precisely because the issues they are about are
ones nothing below would touch safely -- a consumer that
ended wears `done` or `rejected`, reopening leaves the label where it was, and
both are terminal no-ops; a reopened cancelled owner wears a label whose
handler would spawn the decomposer or activate children over a cycle a close
already ended; a restart's own issue wears either no label at all, where the
handler would greet it as new and mint a second pinned comment, or the target
label it applied a moment before a crash, where the cancelled-cycle guard
would hand it `rejected` again; and an issue whose workflow label a human took
off reaches the pickup handler, which GREETS one -- minting a second pinned
comment that the first shadows from the moment it is written, while the
finished workflow in that first one goes on deciding.

That is also why such an issue is partitioned as FAN-OUT rather than into the
family bucket, despite wearing a family-aware label. The bucket's exemption is
all-or-nothing, so a closed owner sharing it with an open `decomposing` issue
would be cap-counted and skipped under saturated caps -- cleanup starved by
work it has nothing to do with. As fan-out it is submitted cap-exempt on its
own, and it does not need the family mutex: what serializes a parent against
its children is a mutex over handlers that ACTIVATE, and this one reads its
consumers and writes only issues it has proved terminal. The fan-out lane
already runs those consumers' own closed-sweep finalizers concurrently, so the
bucket would not have protected against them either.

The spent lifetime agent-run ledger is on that list for the opposite reason:
the issue it is about is one EVERY stage below would touch, and each in a way
that is right about some other park. An `awaiting_human` flag routes one stage
to a resume on the next reply and another to a hold waiting on words, and
neither is an answer to an issue that has run out of the agent runs it may
ever spend. So the park is held once, ahead of the table, rather than taught
to thirteen handlers -- and it is the one question here that steps aside for a
CLOSED issue, since what a close reaches below is a terminal that ends the
issue rather than a road that spends anything on it.

Only issue NUMBERS cross the thread boundary. PyGithub's `Issue` and the
`GitHubClient` / `Repository` / `Requester` chain behind it hold mutable
per-request state that is not documented thread-safe, so `_refetch_and_process`
mints a per-worker client and refetches against it -- every in-flight call is
then the sole consumer of its own requester.

That refetch is also what makes the cleanup classification safe to act on,
which is why the sequential path takes one of its own. A closed owner is
routed to the sweep on a reading taken during enumeration, and the sweep's
re-read of the close is only a question if the issue was read again since -- so
`_process_polled_issue` classifies and refetches on the caller's thread rather
than dispatching the object the poll yielded.

The handler for a label is reached by importing the module
`_STAGE_HANDLER_TARGETS` pairs it with, at call time: twelve of them are
conflicts, decomposition, discussion, documenting, fixing, implementing,
question, validating, and in_review owners under `workflow/stages/`, and the
thirteenth is the `pickup` sibling an unlabeled issue starts on -- and the stage
tree imports this subpackage, so binding any of them
at module scope would point that edge back at itself. Every entry names the
owner its handler lives on, so the patch that intercepts a dispatch is the one
against whichever module the table names.

) -> bool:
    """True when what this issue's own pinned comment records stops the tick.

    ONE read, seven questions, because the read is what costs -- a comment
    walk per labelled issue per tick, on top of the one that issue's own
    handler makes.

    The first is a restart an operator has authorized. A settled cancellation
    whose `rejected` has been taken off is a fresh cycle waiting to be
    projected, and so is one this orchestrator already began and left
    half-applied -- a restart writes its target label before it retires the
    marker, so a tick that crashed in between finds a live-looking label over
    a record that still says cancelled.

    The second is a live late adjudication. An oversized committed candidate is
    adjudicated under ``workflow:decomposing``, and while that question is open
    the label is not a state anything else may set. A hand relabel cannot be
    refused where it is written -- the orchestrator never sees that write -- so
    it is caught here, the one place a label becomes a handler call: the issue
    is put back and left for the next tick rather than dispatched to whichever
    stage the new label named, which for ``ready`` or ``implementing`` would
    publish a candidate nobody adjudicated.

    The third is a child of a split whose snapshot has since been reclaimed.
    That one has to be asked HERE rather than inside a stage, because the issue
    it is about is one the dispatcher would otherwise have nothing to do with:
    a consumer that ended wears ``done`` or ``rejected``, reopening leaves the
    label where it was, and both are terminal no-ops below. Asking before the
    table also means a relabel straight to another stage cannot route around
    it. It costs nothing extra on the wire in the steady state -- the guard
    asks this host before it asks the remote.

    The fourth is an owner whose cycle a close already ended and whose cleanup
    has not finished. Cancellation is irreversible within a cycle, so a human
    who reopens the issue gets a fresh one -- but not while the old one still
    holds a branch, a ref, or a held pull request, because both labels an
    adjudication can be wearing name a handler that would act on the issue
    rather than settle it.

    The fifth is an unlabeled issue this orchestrator has already met. What an
    unlabeled issue reaches is the pickup handler, which GREETS one, and a
    pinned comment is the record of having been greeted -- so it is asked LAST
    and answered off the read alone. The one unlabeled issue it must not stop
    is the restart, which is answered four questions above it and returns
    before this one is reached.

    The restart and the unfinished cleanup are asked FIRST, because they are
    the ones that have to RUN rather than merely answer, and the three below
    them can refuse indefinitely. The reuse guard HOLDS a dispatch -- writing
    nothing, on purpose -- for as long as an ancestor's ref cannot be asked
    about, and an owner of its own cancelled cycle nested under such an
    ancestor would spend that entire outage never reconciling its own held PR,
    branch, or ref. Nothing is lost by the order: neither a cancelled cycle
    nor a restart mid-transaction starts any work, so neither question below
    is about anything either is going to do, and both are asked again on the
    tick after the ending or the fresh cycle is written.

    The restart comes ahead of the cancellation refusal within that pair, and
    only one of the two can be about a given issue: an issue with a marker
    standing, or with the authorizing gesture on its surface, is one the
    refusal would answer by handing it `rejected` again -- undoing the
    authorization the restart is halfway through honoring.

    The adjudication and the reclaimed snapshot step aside for the label the
    adjudication actually sits on, which is where every one of its own ticks
    is spent, and where an ancestor's snapshot is not what the issue is
    working from -- but only once the record PROVES the adjudication is this
    issue's own, and never past the reading that asks whether that record can
    be acted on at all. The label alone proves nothing: a child of a split
    closed while it was being decomposed comes back with ``decomposing`` exactly
    where it was and no generation at all, and its ancestor's ref may well
    have been reclaimed while it was closed. Waving that through on the label
    would spawn the decomposer against the reuse instructions in its body,
    naming a ref that is gone. So the read is taken first and the label is
    answered out of it. Imported at call time like the handlers below, since
    the stage tree imports this module.

    The last of them is the size gate's own unfinished business, and it is
    asked here for the reason the others are: it belongs to no one stage. A
    pair frozen for a pull request the remote already carries is durable and
    the count that follows it is not, so a tick that died in between leaves a
    record naming both commits with no number on it -- and the handler about
    to run would spawn a reviewer, resume a developer, or read a pull request
    still standing where the gate froze it, while the record goes on freezing
    the branch out of the base refresh. Taking the reading first is what makes
    the freeze a resumable step rather than a window; scoped by the record's
    own source stage, so it is answered on the stage it was entered on and
    nowhere else.

    The spent agent-run ledger is asked between those two groups, and the
    place is the whole point of it. Behind the pair that RUN, because a
    cancelled cycle still holding a branch and a restart an operator
    authorized are endings rather than work, and a park that outranked them
    would leave both owed for as long as the issue is stopped -- which here is
    for good. Ahead of everything else, because every road below is a stage's,
    and a stage reading `awaiting_human` answers it with the park it was
    written against: a resume on the next reply, a hold waiting on guidance, a
    classifier that refuses a command carrying none. None of those is an
    answer to an issue that has spent every run it may ever have.

    Held once, here, rather than taught to each stage. The park is a claim

    resumes a locked developer on the next trusted reply, the conversation

    ``done`` / ``rejected`` are terminal no-ops; an unrecognized label is
    logged and left alone for a human. Timing and the ``stage_evaluation``
    analytics record stay in ``_process_issue``, which wraps this call in its
    try / except / finally.

    Two routes are taken ahead of the table. A closed issue on a cleanup-swept
    label goes to the sweep owner, because its label names a handler that would
    resume the workflow its close ended. And what the issue's own pinned
    comment records can stop the tick outright -- a restart an operator has
    authorized over a settled cancellation, a live adjudication the label was
    moved out from under, a snapshot this child was cut from and the remote no
    longer has, a cancelled cycle this owner has still to settle, or an
    unlabeled issue this orchestrator has already greeted once. The
    cleanup route comes first: that guard spends a pinned read to decide, and a
    closed owner is not dispatched on any of those answers.

    ``cleanup_only`` is that first route arriving as a decision rather than as
    a reading. It is set by the submit that a closed cleanup owner was

    close already earned and stop there, leaving every external part of the
    ending to the guard that owns a reopened cancelled owner from the next
    tick.

    A control label the closed reading was let past is re-applied BEHIND the

    issue on a cleanup-swept label is refetched before anything routes it, and
    a CLOSED reading at poll time additionally BINDS it to the sweep.

    The refetch is the load-bearing half, and it is taken on both readings of
    the close rather than on one. The object in hand is the enumeration's,
    and the two labels this applies to are the two where the close decides
    which handler runs: an owner closed after the poll would otherwise reach
    the stage its label names on a stale open reading -- spawning the
    decomposer, or walking a dependency graph and activating children, on an
    issue a human just ended -- and an owner reopened after the poll would
    have a cleanup pass settle a ledger the live cycle is writing again, since
    the sweep's own close re-read would be re-reading the same stale object.

    The binding is the other half, and it is one-way for the reason the
    workers' is: a closed classification may not become an agent-spawning
    stage handler on the strength of a reopen this tick raced, while an issue
    that was open when it was polled has been classified as ordinary work all
    along and the freshly-read close is what sends it to the sweep.

    Refetched on the caller's own client rather than through
    `_refetch_and_process`: nothing here crosses a thread, so what that mints
    a per-worker client for does not apply, while the read it takes does.

    Hard-skipped issues are dropped here as the partition drops them, rather
    than inside `_process_issue`, so the classification this path takes is the
    same one the other two take.

    Which labels that applies to is `_cleanup_routed`'s question, and it is
    not the same one the partition asks: a closed issue is routed by any of
    the four cleanup labels, while only the two an adjudication runs under
    earn the refetch an OPEN issue costs.

    A latched close overrides the label as it does in the partition, and for
    the same reason: the reading it carries is one the reopen it survived took
    off the remote, so nothing this path could read would find it. It
    overrides the hard-skip filter with it -- an operator's park defers the
    external half of the ending, which is what the sweep does with a parked
    issue anyway, and never the mark. And the cleanup it routes to is wrapped
    in the same observation hold the worker paths use, because a pass that

    """Enumerate pollable issues this tick and hand work to the scheduler.

    Family-aware work (unlabeled pickup + decomposing / blocked /
    umbrella -- the cross-issue writers) is folded into ONE bucket
    submit per repo that drains its issues sequentially on a single
    worker thread; non-family issues are submitted individually. The
    in-tick parallel path in ``tick()`` partitions the same way (one
    drain task for the family bucket, per-issue futures for fanout).

    One bucket per repo is what keeps the family mutex from starving
    itself. The scheduler grants the family slot to the first accepted
    ``family=True`` submit and silently skips every later one this tick,
    so a per-issue family submit would let a stale ``blocked`` child
    take the slot while the parent ``umbrella`` that should relabel it
    never runs -- and the pair would trade the slot back and forth
    forever. Draining every family issue inside the one accepted submit
    means the umbrella always gets its turn within the same tick.

    The bucket task uses ``scheduler.track_active`` around each
    per-issue iteration so ``scheduler.is_active(repo, n)`` reports True
    for the issue currently being processed inside the bucket -- the
    pre-tick base refresh relies on that signal to avoid rebasing a
    worktree under a running agent. Without per-iteration tracking,
    only the bucket's sentinel key would appear in the in-flight set
    and a concurrent refresh would race the agent.

    Each per-issue callable mirrors the in-tick parallel path: mint a
    fresh ``GitHubClient`` via ``gh._for_worker_thread()`` and refetch
    the Issue against that client so the worker drives its own
    Requester chain (PyGithub is not documented thread-safe).

    Completion reaping is the polling loop's job, not this function's.
    ``runtime.ticks.run_tick`` calls ``scheduler.reap()`` exactly once
    after every configured repo's tick returns, which is the cadence surfaced
    to operators and documented in ``docs/observability.md`` ("one reap
    per polling pass"). Reaping here as well would multiply that to N+1
    reaps per pass under ``REPOS``.

    ``spec.parallel_limit`` is forwarded as the scheduler's per-call cap
    override so a per-repo configuration tighter than the scheduler
    default still binds. Label-read failures route the offending issue
    into the family bucket so ``_process_issue``'s own exception
    isolation picks up any sustained failure -- the same recovery the
    in-tick parallel path uses.

    When every family-aware issue this tick runs a no-agent handler
    (label in ``_CAP_EXEMPT_FAMILY_LABELS`` -- ``blocked`` or
    ``umbrella``, both pure label/dep-graph walks), the bucket submit is
    marked ``cap_exempt=True`` so it does not consume a
    ``MAX_PARALLEL_ISSUES_PER_REPO`` or ``MAX_PARALLEL_ISSUES_GLOBAL``
    slot. Such a bucket must always get its turn even when the caps are
    saturated by ordinary implementation work -- otherwise a ``blocked``
    parent polling its own children would be starved of the only
    per-repo slot (under the default ``parallel_limit=1``) and deadlock
    the very children it waits on. A bucket containing ``decomposing``
    (spawns the decomposer agent) or an unlabeled-pickup ``None`` stays
    cap-counted. ``backlog`` / ``paused`` issues are filtered out before
    this split -- a parked issue carries no workflow label, so leaving it in
    would fold it into the bucket and force ``cap_exempt=False``, starving
    fanout behind a hard-skip hold under ``parallel_limit=1``. The family mutex
    still applies, so a follow-up tick that finds another family issue
    still serializes against this bucket.

    Closed fan-out issues are likewise submitted ``cap_exempt=True``: a
    closed issue carrying a sweep label (``in_review`` / ``fixing`` /
    ``resolving_conflict`` / ``question`` / ...) only runs a terminal
    finalization (flip to ``done`` / ``rejected`` + branch cleanup) with no
    agent spawn, so it must not be starved behind active agent work -- a
    merged-PR issue could otherwise sit closed-but-labeled for many ticks
    while a sibling ``validating`` / ``documenting`` agent holds the only
    per-repo slot. A closed ``decomposing`` / ``umbrella`` owner is a fan-out
    submit for exactly this reason: its handler is the cleanup sweep, which
    settles a ledger and spawns nothing, and folding it into the bucket would
    make its turn depend on whatever else landed there.
