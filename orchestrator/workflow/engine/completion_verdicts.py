"""The two markers a terminal agent closes its own stage with: the reviewer's
`VERDICT:` line, and the documentation run's `DOCS: NO_CHANGE`.

Both are read out of the agent's last message, both take the LAST match -- so
a marker quoted from the contract the prompt taught earlier in a long message
loses to the concluding line -- and both answer `unknown` to anything short of
the marker they promise. Prose that merely sounds like an outcome ("no changes
needed") is not the agent committing to one, so the caller parks a human in
rather than recording a decision nobody made.

Where the two differ is how much shape the marker must have, and that follows
from what each one says. A review verdict names its own outcome, so an inline
`VERDICT: APPROVED` is still a statement about the diff. The documentation
marker only says there was nothing to write, which the sentence after it can
take back -- so it counts as the FINAL line and nothing else: alone on that
line, unpunctuated, with the message ending there. The documentation stage's
other outcome, that docs WERE updated, is not read here at all; it is a fresh
commit on the branch, which the stage handler sees.

Each parser also returns the slice above its marker, because that body is the
part a human is shown -- the reviewer's requested changes quoted onto the pull
request, the one line justifying a no-change -- while the marker itself is
vocabulary this module owns and the thread never needs.
