"""The open PRs this orchestrator never opened, and the one ping each earns.

This pass has no per-issue home. A PR opened by somebody else carries no pinned
state for a handler to consult, so nothing dispatches it and the tick drives
the sweep itself instead -- once, ahead of the scheduler / in-tick split, so a
newly opened outsider PR is answered on either dispatch path.

`ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS` is what decides there is anything to sweep at all. An
empty list is the default, and it leaves a single-user deployment the legacy
"anyone is trusted" behavior: the sweep returns before it costs a request.

The label is the sweep's own dedup marker rather than an operator control,
which is why the ping is posted BEFORE it. A label write that fails repeats a
ping on the next tick; a label written ahead of a comment that fails would
suppress the ping forever and no human would ever be called. Both spellings are
read for the same reason -- a PR labeled on a repository the bootstrap rename
could not reach has already had its one ping, and re-labeling it would repeat
that ping.

Nothing here may raise. The enumeration and each per-PR step are caught
separately, so a PyGithub lazy-load failure on one PR costs that PR's ping
rather than the rest of the sweep, and the sweep cannot cost the tick its
issues.
