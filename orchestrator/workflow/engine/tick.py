"""One repo's polling pass: the order it drives, and how its issues execute.

`tick` is the whole per-repo unit of work, and the order of the passes it
drives is the contract. The base refresh goes first because everything after it
reads what that fetch left behind -- a handler would otherwise rebase onto the
base SHA its worktree was created at, and the skill catalog would ls-tree a
stale `<remote_name>/<base_branch>`. It is also the only pass whose failure is
caught here, because a fetch that fails must not cost the tick its issues; the
sweep and the catalog are internally fail-open and cannot raise at all.

The community sweep and the skill-catalog emission are driven from here rather
than from the stage tree because neither has a per-issue home: a PR the
orchestrator never opened carries no pinned state for a handler to consult, and
the catalog is producer-side observability about the repo rather than about any
issue. Both run before the scheduler / in-tick split so they fire exactly once
per tick on either path.

Past that split the tick either hands every issue to the scheduler and returns
without waiting, or runs them itself under `parallel_limit`. The two in-tick
modes are not one loop at two widths, so only one of them is here. `limit == 1`
streams `list_pollable_issues()` directly on this thread, because materializing
it first would lose every already-yielded issue when a pagination error raises
mid-sweep; `limit > 1` is the bounded pool on `parallel.py` beside this one,
which materializes because its executor has to be sized. Both wrap each issue
in its own try/except, so one raising handler never stops the rest.

Every collaborator is named on the owner that defines it, the three passes
above included: `_refresh_base_and_worktrees` on `git/base_sync/refresh.py`,
the sweep on `community.py` beside this one, the catalog emission on
`orchestrator/skills/catalog.py`, and the bounded-pool execution on
`parallel.py`. A mock aimed at one of them lands on that owner; one left
anywhere else would let the real pass run. The line an isolated per-issue
failure reports on comes from `dispatch.py` for the same reason: the isolation
points here and on the parallel owner would otherwise spell it four ways.

    Materializing would change observable behavior on a partial enumeration

    owner's ledger, and an owner reopened after this tick listed it has to be
