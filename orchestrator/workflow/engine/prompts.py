"""The prompt builders the workflow stages share, and the notes folded in.

Each conversation-carrying builder opens on the same header: the issue body,
the thread text ``comments.py`` already trust-filtered, and the tracked-repository
block beside it. That shared opening is why an untrusted author's comment is
absent from the implement, review, documentation, decompose, question, and
discussion prompts alike -- one filtered read feeds all six -- and why the
placeholders for an empty body or an empty thread read the same in each. The
blank line those sections are joined on comes from ``comments.py`` too, so a
quoted thread and the prompt assembled around it break into paragraphs the same
way.

The notes appended below it are contracts the rest of the workflow enforces.
``_FOREGROUND_ONLY_NOTE`` goes on every prompt that can end in a commit: a
backgrounded build outlives no session, so its result is never observed and the
issue parks forever. ``_COMMIT_STYLE_NOTE`` goes on the subset of those whose
agent also writes a subject, since the repo's own `git log` is the style
authority and never a hardcoded type list. The conflict prompt is the one that
takes the first note without the second -- its agent finishes an in-progress
rebase, replaying subjects somebody else already wrote. The two discussion
prompts take both, even though most of their rounds commit nothing: the round
a human confirms the design on writes the plan and its subject, and which round
that is is not knowable when the prompt is built.

A prompt that promises a marker -- ``VERDICT:``, ``DOCS: NO_CHANGE``, ``ACK:``,
the fenced manifest -- spells out the exact literal ``messages.py`` and the
manifest parser then match, and says outright that prose in its place is parked
rather than guessed at. The child cap the decompose prompt states is read back
off the validator that rejects past it, for the same reason: a bound the agent
is told and a bound it is judged against must be one number.

A prompt with only one caller is built where that caller lives: ``drift.py``
composes the drift-resume prompt beside the route that sends it and borrows both
notes from here.

    conversation's first, and any later one whose backend returned no session
    id to resume. Both need the issue body, the title, and the trusted thread
    inline, because the agent reading it has nothing cached to answer against.

    The stage exists to widen a design before anyone commits to it, so this
    prompt is shaped against the two ways an agent narrows one. It has to
    research the repository itself, because a round spent asking humans for
    facts that `git log` answers is a round the design does not advance; and it
    has to keep the questions it comes back with at the architecture level,
    because trivia crowds out the decisions a human is actually needed for.

    What it must end on is a numbered frontier: the subset of open questions
    whose answers do not depend on another open question, each with a
    recommended answer, so a human replies by number instead of re-deriving the
    tree. Everything downstream of those waits for a later round, which is what
    keeps one comment from asking for a decision that the answer above it may
    make moot.

    way, the agreed design is written down in `plan_path` and committed there,
    alone: that commit is the stage's only artifact, and the orchestrator
    checks the branch against the base before publishing it, so the prompt

    the issue up in `implementing` starts from that groundwork instead of
    re-deriving it. The implementer reads the issue thread via
    `_recent_comments_text` at spawn, so anything included here reaches it.
    A comment (not a body edit) is deliberate: rewriting the issue body
    would shift the user-content hash and trip `_detect_user_content_change`
    into re-decomposing the issue on the next tick.

    Every field beyond `decision` is best-effort. `_parse_manifest` only
    validates the decision string for the single branch, so `rationale` /
    `affected_files` / `notes` may be any JSON value or missing; coerce
    non-strings / non-lists to empty rather than parking a valid single
