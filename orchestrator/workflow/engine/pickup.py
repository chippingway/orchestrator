"""The first tick an unlabeled issue gets, and the anchors it leaves behind.

Two decisions live here and nothing else does. `ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS` decides
whether the orchestrator answers an unlabeled issue at all -- it is the abuse
guard that keeps a stranger on a public repo from spending agent budget, and it
fires only on this path, so a maintainer who labels an outsider's issue by hand
still drives it through every later stage. `DECOMPOSE` decides which stage
answers: `decomposing` normally, or `implementing` directly when the switch is
off.

Both starts then write the same four things in the same order, because
everything downstream reads them back. The pickup comment goes first so its id
can anchor `pickup_comment_id`: the validating handoff seeds its watermark past
the orchestrator's own comments, and with no anchor the earliest bot id it can
find is a much later "PR opened" or approval -- which would silently consume
every human comment in between, including a "do not merge yet" posted while the
developer ran. The `user_content_hash` baseline is computed after that comment
exists and with its id filtered out, so the orchestrator's own greeting is not
the first drift the next tick reports. The workflow label is written before the
pinned state so a crash between the two leaves an issue the next tick still
routes to the stage it was committed to, rather than an unlabeled one that would
be greeted a second time.

The chosen handler runs in the same tick rather than waiting for the next one:
the label write already committed the issue to that stage, so returning here
would buy nothing but a poll interval.
