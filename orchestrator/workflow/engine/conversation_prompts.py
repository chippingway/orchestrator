    Every round that cannot be handed to a live session gets this one: the
    conversation's first, and any later one whose backend returned no session
    id to resume. Both need the issue body, the title, and the trusted thread
    inline, because the agent reading it has nothing cached to answer against.

    The stage exists to widen a design before anyone commits to it, so this
    prompt is shaped against the two ways an agent narrows one. It has to
    research the repository itself, because a round spent asking humans for
    facts that `git log` answers is a round the design does not advance; and it
    has to keep the questions it comes back with at the architecture level,
    because trivia crowds out the decisions a human is actually needed for.

    What it must end on is a numbered frontier: the subset of open questions
    whose answers do not depend on another open question, each with a
    recommended answer, so a human replies by number instead of re-deriving the
    tree. Everything downstream of those waits for a later round, which is what
    keeps one comment from asking for a decision that the answer above it may
    make moot.

    The agent runs in the per-issue `issue-N` worktree under the same
    expectations the `question` stage sets -- the orchestrator parks on any
    commit or dirty tree -- with one exception the human has to unlock. Once
    they confirm on the thread that both sides understand the design the same
    way, the agreed design is written down in `plan_path` and committed there,
    alone: that commit is the stage's only artifact, and the orchestrator
    checks the branch against the base before publishing it, so the prompt
    states the same bound the check enforces. The path is passed in rather
    than spelled here because the owner that refuses to publish anything else
    is the owner that names it.
