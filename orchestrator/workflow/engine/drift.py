    On the FIRST call for an issue (no prior hash in pinned state), persist

    in-memory only would lose the baseline whenever the calling handler's
    early-return path (awaiting-human-with-no-new-comments, debounce,
    child-waiting-on-deps, …) skips its own state write; the very next
    edit would then be classified as the new baseline and silently
    absorbed. The cost is one extra write per legacy issue still missing
    the field on first encounter; in steady state the hash is already set
    and this branch never fires.

    Legacy-hash normalization: an issue whose baseline was written by the
    pre-issue-#729 algorithm (which counted a bare `/orchestrator continue`
    comment) compares unequal to the new `current` even when the requirements
    did not change. Before reporting drift, recompute with the OLD algorithm
    (`include_bare_continue=True`); if that reproduces the stored baseline the
    delta is purely the algorithm change, so persist the new baseline and report
    no drift. This keeps a bare continue outstanding at deploy time from firing
    one false "issue body/content changed" route.
