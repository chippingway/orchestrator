"""Which lines of a developer's Markdown message a code fence may enclose.

The report reader asks so that a marker line Markdown shows as code is never
read as the outcome. The answer is reached without a Markdown parser, so a
doubt reads as fenced: a fence opens at the top level or behind the markers of
the list items its line opens, closes only on a bare run at its opening run's
column, and stays open to the end of the message past a line that may have
ended the list item it sat in. A blockquote's fence needs no reading: every
line inside one opens on `>`, and no marker line does.
