"""Every comment the orchestrator posts, and every comment it reads back.

The write side stamps ``_ORCH_COMMENT_MARKER`` onto each body and records the
returned id in pinned state, because recognizing the orchestrator's own
messages later needs both: the id list is exact but bounded by
``_ORCH_COMMENT_ID_CAP``, and the marker survives eviction from it. Neither can
be replaced by author-login matching -- a PAT shared with a human reviewer's
account would have that reviewer's real comments swallowed as bot noise.

The read side is the one choke point every conversation-carrying agent prompt
draws its thread text from, so the ``ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS`` trust filter is
applied here. An untrusted author's comment is dropped whole rather than
trimmed, which is what keeps an outsider on a public repo from steering a
coding agent through the issue thread.

The tracked-repository awareness block sits beside the thread read because both
are bounded, non-secret context folded into the same agent prompts. So is the
paragraph break the thread read joins its quoted comments with: ``prompts.py``
assembles its own sections around that quote with the same break, and one
definition is what keeps the two reading as a single document.
