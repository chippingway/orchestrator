r"""What a park comment and a log line say about an agent run that produced no
usable message: its stderr and the exit code beside it.

Two budgets over one tail, because the two readers are different -- a park
comment quotes 1KB for a human who came to the issue to find out what broke,
and a WARNING quotes 400 characters so the line still fits a screen. Both run
the shared redactor over the RAW stderr before trimming to either budget: a
secret straddling the cut would otherwise be sliced into a fragment the
redactor no longer recognizes, and the fragment is the part that leaks. The
same ordering is why the redaction precedes `rstrip` -- a multi-line env value
ending in `\n` (an SSH or PEM key) would no longer match its environment value
verbatim once the trailing newline is eaten.

The comment block renders through `messages._as_blockquote`, the one quoting
form every agent output an issue carries is rendered with, so a diagnostic
block reads the same as the last-message body it is appended under.

    `_Last … message:_` body.

    Redaction happens on the raw stderr before any trimming: a multi-line
    secret env value (e.g. an SSH/PEM key whose env-var value ends in `\\n`)
    echoed at the end of stderr would otherwise have its trailing newline
