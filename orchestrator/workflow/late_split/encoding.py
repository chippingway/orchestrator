"""What one late generation is spelled as in the pinned comment.

The write side of the round trip, apart from the operations that apply it: the
question here is what each field BECOMES, and the answer has to be the same
spelling the readers on the other side already know -- a vocabulary member as
its wire string, an unset field as nothing at all.

A record with no cycle identity records only what it owes: the two ledgers, if
either holds anything. Everything else on such a record is a half-record
nothing could correlate to an audit line or a child's lineage, while an
obligation stays an obligation whatever happened to the identity that was
written beside it.

Past that gate each field says for itself what "unset" means. A field at its
own empty value -- an absent identity, an empty SHA, a flag that is not set --
names itself None here and is dropped, so the pinned comment carries what this
generation actually knows. A lineage depth of 0 is not one of them: it is the
root of a lineage, and it is written as itself. What is dropped there is an
unknown depth, which is not the same thing and must not be recorded as if it
were.

The publication provenance is additive twice over, and this encoding is what
makes the second half of that true: a generation entered before the work was
published records none of the group, which is the same pinned comment a binary
that never had the group writes. One state, one spelling -- so reading an
absent flag as a pre-publication entry is right about a live issue without a
migration having reached it.
