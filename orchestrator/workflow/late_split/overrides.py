"""The one oversized candidate an operator authorized to publish as it stands.

An oversized candidate has two ways past the size gate. The first is the
workflow's own: an adjudication rules it one coherent change, and the
`exemption` owner beside this records the commit that verdict was reached
about. The second is a human's. An operator who has read the change can say,
in a comment on the issue, that it publishes unsplit -- and that gesture has
to outlive the process that read it, the generation it was made under, and the
tick that would act on it, or the gate measures the same candidate past the
same ceiling on the next poll and asks the same question again.

This record is that authorization made durable, and every term of it follows
from what it IS: a bypass of the one gate that stops unreviewed bulk reaching
a pull request. A bypass may license exactly what a human looked at and
nothing beside it, so the record is bound to the candidate rather than
declared over the issue -- a flag would authorize whatever the worktree ends
on next, and a commit alone would authorize whatever that commit turns out to
contribute once a base moved under it.

So it names the whole of what was authorized. The exact candidate SHA, which
is the commit a human read. The frozen base it was read over, since the same
commit contributes something else over another one. The canonical digest of
the contribution between that pair and the scheme the digest was taken under,
which together are what says the change on the branch is still the change that
was authorized. And the measurement that made the candidate oversized in the
first place: the additions counted, and the ceiling they were counted against.

Those last two are recorded HERE rather than read off the generation beside
them, and that is the point of them. The generation is cleared when the cycle
that earned this record ends, and the ceiling is a knob an operator retunes --
so a record that pointed at either would answer differently later, about a
decision that was made once. What a human authorized is a change of THIS size
against THAT ceiling, and a record carrying both is one a later reader can
still hold the authorization to.

The comment is what makes the authorization attributable. A bypass of the size
gate is licensed by a gesture somebody made in a place anybody can go and
read, so the record names that comment by its id: a caller offering an
authorization it cannot locate is offering an unattributable field on a pinned
comment, which is the one thing this record may not become. Whether the author
was trusted is proved before the write rather than stored beside it -- the
allowlist is an operator's own and moves, and the durable half of the evidence
is which comment was acted on.

Read fail-closed, whole or not at all, and more strictly than the exemption
beside it. There, the exact-SHA field is a claim that stands alone and the
identity is what a damaged member costs. Here every member IS the
authorization: a field that is missing, one that is not the shape its field
takes, a digest taken under a scheme this build does not compute, a comment id
that is not an identity, and a measurement that is not one -- including a
record whose additions are not strictly past its own threshold, which
describes a candidate the gate would have published untouched -- each read
back as no authorization at all. What that costs is a measurement, which is
the answer a damaged bypass has to give.

The write refuses the same values rather than recording them, for the reason
every other late writer does: a caller handed a term it cannot vouch for has
an authorization in hand and nowhere to put it, and recording one would move
the failure onto a reader whose only move is to let unmeasured work publish.
The whole group goes down in one statement and replaces whatever stood there,
so a record is never half about one candidate and half about another.

The keys sit outside `LATE_STATE_KEYS` for the reason the exemption's do: this
is what a generation is cleared AGAINST, and a clear that took it would send
the authorized candidate back into the adjudication a human already answered.
Everything else on the pinned comment is left exactly as found -- the fields
this owner names and no others -- so an unknown field, and an exemption group
an older binary wrote, are preserved verbatim by both the write and the clear.

What the record does not do is publish anything. It is durable evidence, and
what a candidate publishes under is decided where publications are.
