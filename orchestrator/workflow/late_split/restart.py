"""The two-phase restart marker, and the identities it is allowed to name.

A restart after a completed cancellation is a transaction over the same pinned
comment: the new cycle is persisted first, the notice and the label follow,
and only a reconciled pair retires the marker. This owner is both halves of
that, kept apart from the round trip beside it because what it decides is an
identity, not a field: which cycle a restart intends, and whether the one a
crashed tick left behind may still be believed.

`LateRestartTarget` is the whole of what a restart may apply, and it lives
here because applying one is what this owner does. The two members are the
workflow labels themselves, so a target read back out of a pinned comment is
either one of them or nothing at all.

Believed is the operative word, and it takes the whole marker rather than one
field of it. A marker is this domain's own only when all four agree: the
pending flag is set, the target is one of the two states a restart may put an
issue back into, the predecessor is exactly the cycle the record is on, and
the pending cycle is exactly the next one after it. Anything else is a damaged
field rather than a restart in flight -- a cycle 500 predecessor under cycle 2
is ancestry nothing wrote, and a pending cycle of 99 is a number an audit
record has no line for. Both halves re-mint from the current cycle instead,
which is the same answer a first entry gets, so a corrupted marker costs one
notice rather than a fabricated lineage. What a *caller* asks for is checked
before any of that: a target no restart may apply is refused whether or not a
marker is already standing, because the argument is a bug either way.

Retiring is the one operation here that refuses rather than re-deriving. The
fresh cycle keeps no ledger -- a restarted issue owns nothing on the remote
yet -- so retiring while an obligation is still pending, retained, failed, or
of a shape this binary could not read would delete the only record that the
remote is owed anything. Restart is reachable only from a cancellation whose
cleanup completed, so a generation that cannot show that is one whose restart
has not come due; `obligations_settled` is the same question a caller can ask
before getting the refusal.
