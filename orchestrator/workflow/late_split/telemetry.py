"""The dual emission one late event is written to both sinks by.

One call, two independent writes: the audit stream through the client's own
`emit_event`, and the analytics stream through the recording package's
envelope and append. Both carry the identical bounded payload the `records`
owner built, so an operator analyzing the JSONL audit copy offline reaches the
same answers as the database over the analytics sink -- which is the point of
writing twice rather than choosing one.

Neither write may change what the workflow does. The two sinks already
swallow a filesystem refusal, and each call here additionally rides its own
guard, so a bug or a client that raises costs the record and nothing else: a
late generation is reconciled from its pinned state, never from what a sink
accepted. For the same reason a failed first write does not skip the second --
they are separate observability surfaces, and one being unavailable is not a
reason to lose the other.

Building the payload rides the same guard, and for the stricter reason. The
`records` owner refuses to describe a generation or an event that cannot
satisfy the contract, and that refusal has to end here: nothing is written,
the refusal is logged where an operator will see it, and the tick that asked
carries on. A record nobody should have written and a tick broken by the
attempt to write it are both failures; only the first one is recoverable.

What a refusal is allowed to say is bounded for the same reason the record
is. The values it reports are exactly the ones that just failed to prove
themselves, so an issue number that is not one and a family that is not a
member are reported as a sentinel rather than as they arrived -- a log line is
the same surface one step over, and the boundary would be worth nothing if
prose refused from a sink were written into it instead. That is also why the
failure is named rather than raised into the log: `log.exception` renders the
exception's own text and traceback, and only this domain's refusals are built
to be repeatable. One raised anywhere below is reported by its type alone.

`stage` is bounded here rather than passed through, because it is the one
field of the envelope this owner supplies and the sinks would carry anything.
It is resolved against the workflow label vocabulary and written as the bare
stage tag every other emitter on those sinks records, so a caller may name
either spelling and nothing else -- a "stage" carrying a path or an
adjudication's rationale is refused with the record it came with.
