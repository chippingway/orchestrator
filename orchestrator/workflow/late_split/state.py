"""The round trip one late generation takes through the pinned comment.

The durable operations over the `late_*` group and nothing else: what a record
reads back as, what a write leaves behind, and what a clear drops. Which keys
that group is comes off the `keys` owner, what each field is spelled as on the
way out comes off `encoding` and `ledger_encoding`, and what a raw value reads
back as on the way in comes off `payloads` and `ledgers` -- so what is decided
here is the ORDER those are applied in, which is the part a live issue's
comment depends on.

A record with no cycle identity is not a generation, so the write clears the
late fields rather than recording a half-record no later tick could correlate
to an audit line or a child's lineage. The two external ledgers are what it
does not clear: an obligation the remote is owed does not stop being owed
because the identity beside it was damaged, and dropping it would leave a
snapshot or a branch with nothing on the issue to reclaim it by. So an
uncorrelatable record still writes what it owes, and nothing else.

Keys outside this domain are not read or written: the pinned comment is shared
with every other stage, and a late write is only ever about its own fields.
The one key this owner touches that is not the generation's own is the
retirement correlation a write with an IDENTITY supersedes, spelled on the
`endings` owner beside this one. The `restart` owner moves the pending restart
marker rather than this one: the marker is a pinned field, but minting and
validating an identity is its own contract.

    An issue with no late fields reads back as the record's defaults, which
    `LateGeneration.is_present` answers False on -- the one reading that keeps
    a legacy issue out of every late decision without a migration.

    Which reader a field is read through is the field's contract, not its
    Python type: an identity has to be positive, a measurement non-negative, a
    frozen commit a whole object id and a fingerprint a whole digest, a flag
    literally `true`, a source stage one of this workflow's own labels, a
    measurement failure one of the steps the git domain names, and a restart
    target one of the two labels a restart may apply. Anything else
    reads back absent, so a hand-edited or older value never becomes live
    state -- a threshold of -1 does not make an unmeasured candidate oversized,
    and a `"false"` string does not arm a cancellation or a pending restart.

    The lineage depth is the one field with no safe substitute for an
    unreadable value, so it has none: a damaged or missing depth on a recorded
    cycle reads back as unknown rather than as the root's 0, and a lineage
    already at the bound therefore stays unsplittable while its field is
    damaged. The write leaves it unknown too, so nothing normalizes the gap
    away on the next pass.
