"""What one late field in a pinned comment reads back as.

The pinned comment is JSON a human can edit, an older binary may have written,
and a newer one has to survive reading, so nothing here trusts the type it
finds. Each reader answers with the field's own default instead of raising:
the late gate is entered by an issue that already has committed work, and a
`TypeError` out of a state read would strand that work behind a crash on every
poll rather than behind a decision somebody can act on.

Fail-closed is the rule for every reader, and each field is read for what it
actually is rather than for its Python type. A count that is negative is not a
measurement, an identity that is not positive is not an issue or a cycle, a
depth outside the lineage is not one, and a commit field that is not a whole
object id -- nor a fingerprint that is not a whole digest -- is not one -- every one of them reads back absent,
which downstream is "not measured", "not adjudicated", or "may not split", and
never a value a later tick would act on. The two flags are literal: only JSON
`true` is set, because a hand-edited "false" is a string, and reading it for
its truthiness would arm a cancellation or a pending restart nobody wrote.

The one thing this owner does not do is convert. A number is not made out of
something that was not one (the `formats` owner beside it is where that line
is drawn), so `True` is not cycle 1 and 2.9 is not depth 2. The two external
ledgers are read by the `ledgers` owner instead, because their answer to an
unreadable value is to preserve it rather than to default it.
