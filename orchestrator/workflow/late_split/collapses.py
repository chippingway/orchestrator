"""What a squash says it is about to do, before it destroys the evidence of it.

A squash is the one rewrite in this workflow that leaves the branch unable to
describe itself. It collapses the commits a reviewer approved into a single
object with the same tree, so the head it replaced, the base it was read over,
and how many commits went into it are all gone the moment the reset lands --
and a one-commit branch is exactly what a branch nobody ever squashed looks
like. Read afterwards, the two are indistinguishable: the retry takes the
nothing-to-squash road and reports success without measuring or pushing
anything, so reviewer-approved work reaches the merge button neither counted
nor on the remote.

So the rewrite says what it is about to do first, and this is the record it
says it in. It goes down BEFORE the reset and it is the whole of what a later
tick has to tell an interrupted rotation from a finished one:

* the HEAD the squash is collapsing, which is the rollback target and the head
  the force-push behind it is leased against;
* the BASE it is collapsed over, which is the end the contribution a transfer
  is granted on is read from;
* the COUNT of commits going into it, which is the one fact no reading past
  the reset could recover -- the collapsed commits are off the branch, and
  only the reflog still has them.

Three fields and no more, because what a recovery may act on is what it can
check. Every other term the resumed publication needs is asked again from the
world it is about: the pull request is re-read, the checkout is re-proved, the
contribution is re-fingerprinted, and the ceiling is this build's own. A field
here that could not be checked would be a claim a crash could turn into a
push nobody measured.

Read fail-closed and whole or not at all, like every other late record. A
member that is missing, a value that is not a whole object id, and a count
that is not a number of commits a squash collapses each read back as no
pending collapse -- and a comment CARRYING one of those is not the same as one
carrying none, which is the question `carries_pending_collapse` answers for
the caller that would otherwise wave a collapsed branch past as having nothing
to squash.

One boundary is left over once the rewrite is finished, and it is why the
record does not simply go when the push lands. The write that ends the claim
and the relabel behind it are two calls, and an issue left on `validating`
between them is one the next tick runs a second reviewer on, over a branch
already approved, squashed, and published. So the claim is not dropped there
but SETTLED -- replaced by the commit the handoff was made over, which
`handoffs` owns and the route ahead of that reviewer reads to move the label
instead. That successor is deliberately no member of the group here: nothing
about the rewrite is outstanding by then, so nothing may freeze the branch or
refuse to resume over it.

The keys live outside `LATE_STATE_KEYS` for the reason the exemption's do:
they describe a rewrite that outlives the generation it was made under -- the
gate retires one the moment it approves the squashed commit -- so the write
that clears a generation may take none of them.
