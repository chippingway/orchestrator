"""What the two external ledgers are written back as.

The one pair of fields a generation write does not rewrite from the typed
record, which is why the encoder for them sits apart from the one that spells
every other field. A ledger the reader could not fully type comes back
verbatim beside the typed view, and the verbatim copy is what is written: an
obligation an older or newer binary recorded is still owed, and a write that
reduced the ledger to the entries this binary understood would delete it --
leaving a cleanup looking complete and a snapshot looking reclaimable.

It is also the half of the ledger contract a clear does not reach. A record
with no cycle identity is not a generation, so the write beside this one drops
every other late field rather than recording a half-record no later tick could
correlate; an obligation the remote is owed does not stop being owed because
the identity beside it was damaged, and dropping it would leave a snapshot or
a branch with nothing on the issue to reclaim it by.

The wire spellings an entry is composed from are the `ledgers` owner's, beside
the reader that parses them back.
