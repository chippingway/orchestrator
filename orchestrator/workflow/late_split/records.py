"""The bounded record both observability sinks carry for a late event.

One payload is built for both streams, so an operator with only the audit
JSONL answers what the analytics database answers: whether a lineage is
approaching the depth bound, which repositories keep producing
artifact-dominated `single` verdicts, and whether the configured threshold
creates more adjudication than it prevents.

It is bounded four times over, because a type annotation bounds nothing at
runtime. The payload is assembled from a frozen generation and a family-typed
event and from nothing else, so there is no argument through which a file
path, a diff, a prompt, an agent's rationale, or its output could arrive; the
event is asked to prove its own contract again here, so a `verdict` that is a
lookalike string rather than a member never reaches the dict; the generation
is put through the `validation` gate beside this owner, so a "SHA" carrying
prose, a phase that was never a member, a count that is not one, a generation
with no correlating identity at all, and a measurement or verdict that cannot
say which commits it was about each produce no record rather than a record
nobody should have written; and what survives is filtered
through `LATE_PAYLOAD_FIELDS`, so a field added to the builder reaches a sink
only once it has been added to the declared contract as well. A resource's own
name is deliberately not among them -- the record names its kind and carries
`resource_id`, the bounded fingerprint from the `identity` owner, which is
what tells two cleanups of two different children apart without saying which
children they were.

`correlation_key` is the other half of the contract. Records are emitted
before the step they describe is durable, so a crash can produce the same
record twice; a consumer deduplicates on these fields rather than on delivery,
because nothing about workflow disposition may depend on a sink. The key is
therefore the whole record apart from its timestamp: a retried step writes
every field again identically, so `ts` is the only thing that can differ
between one step's two emissions, and any other difference is a different step
-- two splits of one candidate into two children and into seven, two questions
asked under different categories, two restarts aimed at different states, two
measurements against different bases. Listing the distinguishing fields by
hand instead is what let pairs like those collide, because the list has to be
remembered every time the payload grows.
