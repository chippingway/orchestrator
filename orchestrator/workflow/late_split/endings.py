"""What a cycle's ending leaves behind, past the write that clears it.

Two records, kept together because they answer the same question from the two
ends a generation can stop at, and kept OUTSIDE `LATE_STATE_KEYS` for the one
reason both exist: clearing late mode is defined as dropping exactly the
generation's own group, and each of these is a fact about that generation
which has to outlive the drop. A key inside the group would be taken by the
same write it is written in.

The retirement correlation names the cycle a clear dropped. A close observed
INSIDE that write leaves a receipt scoped to a cycle the record no longer
names, and without the correlation there is nothing left to adopt it against.
It names ONE such window and outlives no other: the receipt it correlates to
is a comment, comments are append-only, and a correlation left standing past
its window would let a cycle-scoped receipt be adopted against a record whose
cycle is two generations newer.

The terminal record says a `rejected` was owed and then that it landed. Two
fields because it is a two-phase record, exactly as an external obligation is:
the identity says which cycle the terminal is about and goes down BEFORE the
label write, so a tick that died in between has something durable to come back
to; the flag says the label was PROVED to be on the issue and goes down after.
Only the pair authorizes a restart. An attempt is not a terminal -- a write
GitHub refused leaves an owner that is unlabeled for the reason it always was,
and treating the intent as proof would start a fresh cycle on a gesture nobody
made.

The proof is that the label IS on the issue, and it is reached three ways. The
pass that made the write takes it returning, and has to: a client's cached
labels survive the write that changes them, so reading the issue back would
answer with the label it wore a moment ago -- and a closed owner leaves the
sweep on that write with no second visit to correct it. Any later pass takes
it by SEEING `rejected` on the issue, which is what backfills a cancellation
that ended before this record existed. And where the decision stands with
neither -- a process that died between the label and the flag -- the remote's
own label history is asked, because that window is the one thing no local
record can answer for and an operator's removal would otherwise be spent
re-applying a terminal that had already landed.

Every field here is read through the domain's own readers, so a hand-edited
identity or a `"true"` string reads back as no ending at all -- which refuses
a restart rather than authorizing one on a value anybody could have typed.
