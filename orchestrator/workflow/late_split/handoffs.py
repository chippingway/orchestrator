"""The commit a finished squash still owes its relabel over.

One boundary is left when a rewrite is finished, and this is the record that
covers it. The write that ends the claim and the relabel behind it are two
calls, and an issue left on `validating` between them is one the next tick
runs a second reviewer on, over a branch already approved, squashed, and
published. So the claim is not dropped there but SETTLED -- replaced by the
commit the handoff was made over, which is what the route ahead of that
reviewer reads to move the label instead.

The successor of a pending collapse rather than a member of one, and the
difference is the whole of what this owner is for. Nothing about the rewrite
is outstanding by the time it is written -- the push landed, the notice its
count was worded from went out, and the watermarks behind it are seeded -- so
nothing here may freeze the branch, refuse a resume over it, or hold an agent
off it. What is outstanding is a label, and the record is the only thing that
says it is owed.

Read for a usable value rather than for presence, which is the opposite of
what the group it succeeds is read for and for the opposite reason. An
unreadable claim there describes a branch mid-rewrite, so it has to reach a
refusal; here it describes a rewrite already measured, published, and
announced, where the most an unreadable value can cost is the reviewer round
this route would have saved -- so it is dropped and the round runs.

The key lives outside `LATE_STATE_KEYS` for the reason the collapse's own do:
it describes a rewrite that outlives the generation it was made under -- the
gate retires one the moment it approves the squashed commit -- so the write
that clears a generation may take none of it.
