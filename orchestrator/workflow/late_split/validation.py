"""What a generation has to prove before a record of it may be written.

The type annotations on the record are documentation; this is the enforcement.
Nothing stops a caller from building a generation whose "SHA" is a sentence,
whose phase is a string that was never a member, or whose restart target names
a label no restart may apply -- and every one of those would otherwise be
written verbatim into two append-only sinks, where an operator's `jq` filter
and a Postgres column would then carry it. So the gate runs at the one place a
record is built, and a generation that cannot satisfy it produces no record at
all.

Four rules, and every one of them fails closed:

- **Identity is required.** A record with no cycle, generation, root, or
  current issue cannot be joined to a pinned generation, a lineage, or another
  record of the same step, which is the whole reason the record exists. An
  empty generation is therefore not a thing this domain can report on.
- **A family gets what its own record is read for.** A measurement, and the
  verdict answering it, both have to carry the commits that were frozen and
  the measurement taken against them; a record of either that reported only an
  identity would be a row no threshold study could use. A transfer is held to
  the commits and to nothing else, since what it records is that a reading did
  not have to be taken at all. The other five
  describe reconciliation rather than size, and a restart's fresh cycle has
  deliberately let its commits go, so none of them is held to it.
- **Every other emitted field is checked for what it claims to be.** A commit
  field must be spelled like a git object id, a phase and a source stage must
  be members of their vocabularies rather than strings that resemble them, a
  count must be a real non-negative integer, and a restart target must be one
  of the two states a restart may put an issue back into.
- **A marker may not claim what its record cannot say.** A generation entered
  after publication is recorded as one only while it can still name the stage
  it came from, the pull request the work already had, and the head that pull
  request stood on. A hand-edited comment that leaves the marker over any of
  the three gone would otherwise put a post-publication record with no
  publication in it into both sinks. One family is held to the marker as well
  as to what it carries: a transfer happens only where a pull request the
  remote already carries has been pushed to, so a record of one that could
  not name that publication describes a move nothing could be attributed to.

The refusal never quotes the value it refused. A field rejected for carrying
prose would put that prose in the log line reporting it, which is the same
leak one level over; the field name and the type it arrived as are enough to
find the emitter that built it.
