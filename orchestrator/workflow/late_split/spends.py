"""What a hold's route bookkeeping may close, and what each field may take.

The vocabulary a restored spend is bounded by, kept apart from the pinned
round trip that carries one because what it decides is a CLAIM rather than a
field: whether the pair a comment came back with is one this workflow's routes
could have recorded at all.

The table is what turns a restored spend from "whatever the comment says" into
a bounded claim, and it is per KEY rather than per type because what comes back
is APPLIED to the pinned comment and then read by owners that know what each
field is. An arbitrary key is a write into any field the workflow has -- a
label, a watermark, a park flag. A key with the wrong SHAPE is the same damage
one step in: `["review_round", "later"]` passes any check that only asks
whether a comment can carry the value, and fails at the `int(...)` the cap is
counted with, on a tick nobody is watching.

The keys are spelled as literals rather than imported from the four stage
packages that own them: a stage's bookkeeping stays that stage's to describe
and this owner stays free of the packages that import it.
`tests/workflow/test_spend_vocabulary.py` proves the two lists agree, so a key
added to a route without being added here fails there rather than silently at
a retry.
