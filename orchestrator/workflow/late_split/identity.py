"""The identities a late generation is keyed by, and the content it re-reads.

Two kinds of identity sit together because both answer "is this the same thing
the last tick was working on". The monotonic pair -- a cycle and a generation
-- never repeats a number, so an audit record, a child's lineage, and a
restarted issue's predecessor link all name one attempt and only ever move
forward; the local fingerprints answer the same question about human content,
so a title/body edit and a trusted answer arriving after the late baseline are
told apart from each other rather than collapsed into one "something changed".

The fingerprints are deliberately local. The global `user_content_hash` on
`workflow/engine/drift.py` keeps its meaning and its single baseline; these
hash smaller inputs the late gate chooses -- the title and body alone, and the
trusted comment bodies a watermark the generation carries covers -- so reading
one of them tells the late coordinator WHICH kind of guidance arrived. Which
content goes in is the caller's; both digests are taken here, so one contract
has one implementation. The hashing discipline is the drift owner's: SHA-256
over the parts joined by a NUL, which no comment body can contain, so two
pieces of content cannot be concatenated into a third that hashes the same.

The lineage bound is enforced here at the one place a child's depth is
computed. `MAX_LINEAGE_DEPTH` is the record's invariant, so a caller asking
for a depth past it -- or for one off a generation whose own depth could not
be read -- gets `LineageDepthExceeded` rather than a number that would
silently create a fourth generation.

`resource_fingerprint` is the third identity here, and the only one written
into telemetry: an external resource's own name (a ref, a branch, an issue) is
not something a record may carry, but two cleanups of two different children
still have to be told apart from one cleanup retried. A bounded digest over
the entry's kind and target answers both -- stable across retries of the same
resource, distinct between two of the same kind, and carrying none of the name
it was taken over.
