"""What one late event is, and what its family is allowed to say.

Seven families describe a late generation's whole life -- what a candidate
measured, what the adjudication decided, which typed step failed, what happened
to a snapshot, what a cleanup reconciled, that the owner was cancelled, and
that a restart was taken. Each carries the generation's own correlation, plus
only the detail its family owns, and the record enforces that rather than
trusting the emitter: `_FAMILY_FIELDS` says which fields a family requires and
which it may carry, and anything else raises `InvalidLateValue` where the event
is built. What that refusal says is bounded too -- it names the family only
when the family is a member, because the message is read by a log and a value
refused from both sinks may not arrive there instead. A measurement that
arrives claiming a verdict, or a verdict with no verdict on it, is a bug in an
emitter -- refusing it at construction is what keeps a record that means
nothing out of both sinks and out of every analysis over them.

The type of each detail is checked, not merely annotated. A `StrEnum` member
and the string that spells it compare equal, so `verdict="question"` would
satisfy every comparison here and be written verbatim -- and so would
`category="rationale: inspect /srv/private/key"`. Only an actual member is
accepted, which is what makes the closed vocabularies closed and leaves prose
no field to travel in. `check` re-runs the whole contract, so the record
builder can ask an event it did not construct.

The verdict's two companions are the same rule one level down, and they are
not symmetric because the questions they answer are not. A child count
describes a split and only a split. A category explains where an adjudication
landed: it is required of a `question`, because a question that cannot say
what it is asking about is not analyzable, and it is optional on the other two
-- which is what makes the artifact-dominated `single` verdict a thing
telemetry can count rather than a claim nobody can check.

`category` is a closed vocabulary, not a label an agent writes. The late
decomposer's answer is mapped onto these members by `verdict_category`, which
answers `UNKNOWN` for everything it does not recognize, so an adjudication's
rationale -- the sentences, the file names in them -- has no path into a record
at all. That is deliberate: the vocabulary can be widened here, in a review,
and cannot be widened by what an agent happened to write.

The failure family has two companions of its own, and both are optional
because most of its members answer for a step that took no reading at all. A
size measurement that did not happen carries `measurement_failure` -- the git
layer's own vocabulary for WHICH step it stopped at -- so an analysis can tell
a base the remote would not name from a diff nothing here can pin, both of
which reach the sinks as `measurement_failed` and neither of which is the same
operator's next move. Beside it `detail` carries the one line that step wrote
for itself: free text, and the only field in this domain that is, because the
member says which step and nothing whatever about why. It is bounded rather
than trusted -- one line, capped, and already scrubbed of the credential by
the transport that produced it -- and `measurement_failure_event` is the one
constructor that shapes a raw diagnostic into what the contract will accept,
so an emitter cannot widen the field by handing over more than it holds.

Both are pinned to `measurement_failed` and the line to the step, because a
field allowed beside every member describes none of them. A snapshot the
remote refused and a restart GitHub declined took no reading, so neither has
a step to name or a line to carry; and the roads that refuse a RECORD rather
than a reading -- a pinned comment too damaged to act on, a debt no push can
pay -- hold a sentence written for a human instead, which is exactly the prose
this domain gives no field to. So the contract refuses the companions on any
other failure, and refuses a line with no step over it.
