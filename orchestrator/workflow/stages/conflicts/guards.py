"""The three probes that have to answer before any branch is overwritten.

Two of them exist for one decision: whether a worktree that is behind its
remote PR head may still be force-published. That is the one case where the
stage rewrites a branch it did not just produce, so both probes are written to
fail closed -- an unreadable fetch, an unparsable count, or an unrecognized head
all answer "no" and leave the conservative park in place.

The third is the worktree itself, and which restorer it uses is the whole
point: rebuilding from the PR branch keeps the PR's commits, while the
base-branch restorer would silently discard them.
