"""The three ways a dev session is resumed on a branch mid-rebase.

All three go through one run helper because the session is locked to the
backend that opened it and the agent-action stamp has to move on every resume,
but what they do with the result differs. A body edit resumes on the new body
and consumes the drift comments up front, so its two short-circuits -- a
shutdown interruption and a live pause -- return WITHOUT writing pinned state:
the refreshed hash and the consumed watermark are discarded together, and the
next process re-detects the same edit rather than acting on a run it cannot
trust. A human reply to a park resumes on the reply text and hands the result
to the shared disposition. The third caller is the conflict resolution itself,
which lives beside the rebase that produced the conflicted files.

The reply path is also where `/orchestrator continue` is answered, and the
three-way split matters: a session-failure park retries the dev on a neutral
prompt rather than on the literal command it has no context for, a park that
needs a real answer refuses, and an auto-rebase park is left alone entirely
because the base-sync retry loop -- not this stage -- owns unparking it.
Untrusted authors are dropped before any of that, so an outsider reply neither
steers the dev nor advances the consumed-comment watermark.

Each of the three can end in a commit this stage publishes onto a pull request
the remote already carries, so each goes through the size gate: the fresh
conflict and the reply behind it through the shared conflict disposition, the
body edit through the shared fix publication. All three hand the gate the
round they would have counted, because a held candidate ends the tick on
`workflow:decomposing` and the tail that counts one never runs -- and no later
tick of this stage counts it either, since a settled verdict publishes the
accepted commit and the resumed tick finds a branch already standing on its
base.

    in `resolving_conflict` without parking. The caller returns immediately
    after this helper runs. Persists pinned state on every exit EXCEPT the
    shutdown-sweep-interrupted / live-paused short-circuits, which return
    without writing so the drift stays unconsumed and re-runs next process.

    A body edit resolved into a commit is a content update onto a pull request
    the remote already carries, so it publishes through the shared fix seam
    and its size gate like every other one this stage makes. What that costs
    is a tail this caller may never reach: a held candidate is relabelled to
    the adjudication, and no later `resolving_conflict` tick can count the
