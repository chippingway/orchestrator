"""The two shapes every state-changing exit of this stage shares.

A park is never just a comment: `_park_awaiting_human` mutates the in-memory
pinned state, so the `write_pinned_state` that persists it has to follow on the
same tick or the HITL flag is lost and the next tick re-runs the rebase. This
stage has eleven park sites, which is exactly why the pair lives on one owner
rather than being repeated at each.

A pushed round is the same argument at a larger size: reset `review_round`
because rebasing rewrote the SHAs the reviewer approved, bump `conflict_round`
so the cap can still fire, stamp when it resolved, emit the audit event, flip
the label, and write once. Five exits earn that tail -- the recovered push, the
clean base rebase, the agent resolution, the drift resume, and the no-op flip
(which shares only the counter half, having resolved nothing) -- and the audit
event's `outcome` is what lets a tail of the JSONL sink tell them apart without
re-reading the code.

    Every `resolving_conflict` park pairs `_park_awaiting_human` with the
    matching `write_pinned_state`; routing them through here keeps the two
    from drifting apart across the handler's many exits.

    The reason is recorded durably as well as emitted, because two decisions
    past the park are made on it: whether the tick that finds it standing
    waits for a human or retries the reading that failed, and whether a
    refusal re-taken on a later tick is the SAME refusal.

    `once` answers the second. A refusal a tick can re-take every poll -- a
    ref nothing resolves, a branch that stays diverged -- would put a fresh
    notice on the thread each tick and bury the one an operator has to act on.
    So it is said once, and "once" means once per REASON rather than once per
    park: an issue parked on an agent's question that then becomes diverged is
    being told something new, and telling it is the whole point. Only the
    identical refusal standing again is silent, and there the flags are
    already what a park is, so the state write is all that is owed.

    A transient refusal taken over a park somebody OWES AN ANSWER TO is the
    other silence, and it answers the first decision. Recorded, the reason
    would be the one the next tick reads, and a reading that comes back is
    what clears a transient park -- so a fetch that failed for one poll while
    an agent's question stood unanswered would hand the tick after it a branch
    that reads as nobody waiting, and it would rebase, push, count the round
    and hand a `validating` reviewer work the human was asked about. The park
    already standing is the one that governs; the reading is retried under it
    every tick regardless, and it is not announced again because the notice an
    operator has to act on is the one already on the thread.

    The receipt is the whole of what this tick knows about a round it did not
    run: the resolution was reached, committed, and read by a human as one
    coherent change, and the settlement put it on the pull request. What is
    left is the tail above, with the outcome the round actually had.

    `sync.ahead` is what says the commit reached the remote, and it is asked
    because the receipt cannot: a verdict that parked, or a human who moved
    the label by hand, leaves the same receipt over a commit still on disk
    only. Ahead of the remote the receipt stands and the recovered-commit push
    below carries it through the gate, which is the one road that measures it
    again -- and the tail clears the receipt wherever it finally runs.

    In sync is not the same claim as CARRYING it. A replacement host rebuilds
    the checkout from a pull request that has moved on, and what it gets is a
    branch level with its remote and standing on somebody else's head -- so
    the head the receipt names is proved against the checkout rather than
    inferred from the counters.

    BEHIND the remote is refused for the opposite reason, and it is not the
    round that fails there but the handoff. A remote standing on a descendant
    of the settled commit does carry it, so the round really did land -- but
    the tail hands `validating` this CHECKOUT, and the reviewer spawned behind
    it reuses the worktree as it finds it rather than fast-forwarding to the
    tip. Waved through, the round is counted correctly and a human is then
    shown a verdict taken over the commit the pull request has already moved
    past. So the receipt keeps standing and the divergence guard behind this
    asks a human to reconcile the branch, which is the one thing that makes
    the handoff safe again; the same reading settles the round on the tick
    after that.

    Ahead of every resume, and that ordering is the point. A body edit or a
    human reply that commits records a receipt of its own into the one slot
    this one is waiting in, and the park that let the reply in is no exception
    -- the tick that parked is exactly the tick that could not settle the
    round.
