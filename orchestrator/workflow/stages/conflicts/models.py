"""The records one conflict tick hands between its owners.

`_ConflictContext` is the tick itself. The rebase loop threads it through eight
owners, and bundling the four handles keeps each of them from re-reading pinned
state: the `conflict_round` bump, the label flip, and the audit event all have
to land on the same `state` object the handler read at the top, or a park and
the write that must accompany it would disagree.

`_WorktreeSync` is the worktree measured against the freshly fetched remote PR
head, and the three shapes it can take are the whole reconciliation decision --
in sync, ahead (a prior tick committed but never pushed), or behind (stale or
diverged, and refused).

`_DivergeDecision` is how the diverged-worktree guard answers without the
caller re-deriving it: `parked` says the tick is over, and `publish_lease`
carries the exact PR head validated as orchestrator-produced so the force-push
below leases against that SHA rather than whatever `ls-remote` reports later.

`_ConflictResumeRun` carries what a finished dev resume cannot re-derive: the
worktree it actually ran in (the resume may have re-created it), the result,
and whether an operator paused mid-run.
