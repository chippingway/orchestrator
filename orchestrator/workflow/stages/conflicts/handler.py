"""One `resolving_conflict` tick, in the order its questions have to be asked.

The pinned `pr_number` is read first because everything below it needs the PR;
without one the label can only have come from a manual relabel, so the tick
parks once and waits rather than guessing which branch to rebase. The terminal
arcs come next and outrank the rebase entirely: a PR a human merged after
resolving the conflicts by hand, or one they closed, is the answer to every
question the loop would otherwise ask.

Everything past the terminals belongs to the rebase road, including the
body-edit resume an edit mid-rebase earns. It is decided there rather than here
because deciding it needs the branch fetched and the checkout compared to it:
what a resume starts is an agent whose commit this stage force-pushes, so a
reply answered over a checkout the remote has moved past drops the commits that
moved it, and a round a settlement already published shares the one receipt
slot that resume's own commit would write.

The manually-closed arc has one known gap: once a PR-still-open issue is
flipped to `rejected`, nothing observes a later PR close -- the dispatcher's
terminal branch is a no-op and the polling sweep only picks up closed issues
still labeled `in_review` / `resolving_conflict`. For the "close the issue
first, then the PR" ordering the operator cleans up the worktree, the local
branch, and the remote branch by hand.

    Rebase the per-issue branch onto `origin/<base>`. On a clean rebase

    reviewer re-runs against the rebased tree; if the base hasn't moved
    (branch already up-to-date) skip the push and flip straight to
    `validating` too. On real content conflicts, resume the dev session
    on the locked backend with a conflict-resolution prompt, push the
    resolved commit, and likewise flip to `validating`. Docs do not run
    here: the single docs pass runs after the reviewer's final
    `VERDICT: APPROVED` handoff to `documenting` in
    `_handle_validating`, so every pushed conflict-resolution path
    targets `validating` directly. Cap loops via `MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS`
    (parks awaiting human on exhaustion). On agent timeout / dirty
    tree / push failure, park awaiting human and let the operator
    unstick.

    Rebasing rewrites commit SHAs, so every pushed rebase resets
    `review_round`; validation must re-approve the rebased branch before
