"""What to do with a worktree that does not match its remote PR head.

The default is to refuse: a branch behind its remote head may carry someone
else's commit, and force-pushing the local state would drop it. The single
exception is narrow on purpose -- the worktree is ahead, already rebased onto
the current base, and the head it is behind is one the orchestrator itself
recorded -- and it exists because that is exactly the shape a prior tick leaves
when it rebased and crashed before the push.

The ahead-only case is the other half of the same crash: commits that never
reached the remote. Pushing them is safe, but the follow-up question is not
obvious -- the `fixing` dead-lock reroute also lands unpushed FIX commits here,
which are not a rebase, so the branch is still behind base afterwards. That is
why the push probes rather than assuming, and falls through to the rebase path
when it finds it, letting one round cover both.

Nothing READ off this branch is evidence of a rewrite, and it may not be.
Every commit that reaches here is one an earlier tick made and never
published, and no probe run now tells which kind it is: a rebase that tick
replayed, a resolution its agent authored over conflicted files, or the
unpushed FIX commits the `fixing` drift reroute sends here whether the branch
is behind base or standing on it. Being on base tells them apart no better --
that reroute fires precisely on a branch that already carries its base.

What tells them apart is the RECORD the replay wrote about itself: the head it
replaced and the fork point behind it, put down before the rebase ran, and the
commit it produced, stamped on before the size gate was entered. This push
hands the gate that record and only where it is about the commit in hand --
the head it names is the one this push is leased against, and the commit it
names is the one the checkout is standing on. Everything else presents
nothing and is measured, which is what a change nobody adjudicated is owed.
