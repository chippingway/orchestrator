"""What a rebase this stage published tells the gate about what it replaced.

The exemption an adjudication leaves names the exact commit a human ruled on,
and a REBASE is one of the things this workflow does that turns that rule
against itself: the branch is replayed onto a base that has moved, the object
the reviewer's verdict was about stops existing on it, and the identical
change is measured past the same ceiling and adjudicated a second time. The
per-tick base refresh answers that for the rebase IT publishes. This owner is
here because the refresh does not drive `workflow:resolving_conflict`: the
replay a branch that has stopped merging cleanly needs is this stage's own,
and so is the account of what it replaced.

So the publication of a clean rebase hands the gate the before-state that
rebase destroyed, and `late_transfer` decides on it. What this owner builds is
that evidence and nothing else: it grants nothing, reads no record, and says
nothing about whether the contribution survived.

One caller builds that evidence from a reading of its own, and the reason no
other can is that no other knows what the commit it is publishing IS.
`publication._publish_clean_rebase` ran the replay itself, on this tick, over
a checkout it held still. Everything else this stage pushes is a commit
somebody ELSE made -- a resolution an agent authored over conflicted files,
the unpushed fix commits the `fixing` drift reroute sends over, whatever an
earlier tick left behind for the recovery to find -- and no reading off the
branch tells those apart from a replay.

So the replay writes itself DOWN, in the two steps its own shape forces. The
head it is about to replace, the fork point that head was read over, and the
pull request it is all being made against go down before the rebase runs --
the first two because the rebase destroys them, the third because `pr_number`
is a field a later tick can find pointing somewhere else and a rewrite is
evidence about ONE publication. The commit the replay produced is stamped on
once there is one, before the size gate is entered, because that is the field
a later tick matches the branch against -- and it is what makes a stale record
inert rather than dangerous: a group naming a commit this checkout is not
standing on describes a replay that is not what is in hand. The tick that
finds an unpushed replay is answered from that record; a commit no record
names is measured.

Two writes on one road, and both are spent only where an exemption could
actually be carried: a branch not standing on the commit this issue exempts
can never earn a transfer, so nothing there is worth a request.

Both ends are read as FORK POINTS rather than as the base branch's tip,
because the two contributions are read over different bases -- that is what a
rebase is -- and the pre-rebase one is gone from the branch the moment the
replay starts. The pre-rebase reading is therefore taken while the branch
still stands where it did, and the caller carries it across the rewrite.

The head the push is LEASED against and the head it replaced are one commit
here, which is what makes the evidence nameable at all: a rebase runs only
over a checkout this stage proved in sync with its remote, so the commit being
replayed is the commit the pull request is standing on. The squash seam is
where those two really part, and it hands them in separately for that reason.

A caller that cannot name every end gets nothing rather than a partial claim.
Evidence with a hole in it is evidence a later reader could not check, and the
answer to having none is the ordinary cumulative gate -- the same measurement
every install took before an exemption could move at all, and the same one a
replay that moved a byte gets, since it fingerprints to another contribution.
