"""The two ways a rebase attempt ends, and what each publishes.

A clean rebase has three exits and a PROVED clean tree gates all of them,
including the one that pushes nothing. A no-op flip carries the worktree into
`validating` untouched, where the reviewer agent reads the tree directly -- so
an uncommitted edit left by a tick that crashed before its own dirty check
would put the reviewer's vote against content the PR does not have, and the
in_review ready-ping would then advertise that approval to a human merger. A
status nobody could read is that same edit with nothing to name it, so it
refuses too.

What the branch is standing on afterwards is proved rather than assumed, for
one step further on: an unreadable head read as "the base had not moved" hands
the round back to validating without anything having established whether the
rebase left a rewritten commit the pull request never received.

The no-op flip still bumps `conflict_round`. Nothing was resolved, but PyGithub
cannot tell a content conflict from a PR blocked by branch protection or
required reviewers, so without counting the no-op an unmergeable-for-other-
reasons PR would bounce between `in_review` and `resolving_conflict` forever
with the cap never firing.

Real content conflicts go to the dev instead, and the push that follows is
leased against the pre-rebase HEAD: the agent rewrote history from that SHA, so
that is the only remote state the force-push may legitimately replace.
