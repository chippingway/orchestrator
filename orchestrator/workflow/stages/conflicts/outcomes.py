"""What a finished dev run left behind, in the order it has to be read.

Three dispositions precede any look at HEAD, and the order is load-bearing. A
shutdown-sweep interruption comes first because a killed run's output cannot be
trusted at all -- it returns without writing pinned state, so the whole tick's
in-memory bookkeeping is discarded and the next process re-runs from durable
state. Then a timeout, then a rebase still mid-flight, because a HEAD that
moved during an unfinished rebase says nothing about whether the conflicts were
resolved.

Only after those does the HEAD comparison mean anything: unchanged is a
question or silence and parks like the implementing handler does, a dirty tree
refuses to publish an incomplete branch, and a real new commit is pushed. The
`conflict_round` bump lives on the success path alone -- a human-reply resume
that lands cleanly should consume a slot, but a timeout or push failure on the
same counter should not, or the cap would fire on rounds that never ran.

    their push replaces before the agent ran and the gate reads that pull
    request again after it: a fresh conflict names the pre-rebase head it
    rebased from, and a resumed park names the tip the pull request was
