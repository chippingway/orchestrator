"""The pinned keys the conflict owners key their decisions on.

Every name here is written into the pinned JSON comment live issues already
carry, so renaming one is a migration of every open PR rather than a refactor.
They sit here rather than on whichever owner writes one first because the
writer is never the only reader: `conflict_round` is bumped by five different
exits and read by the cap that ends the loop, and `review_round` is reset by
this stage but consumed by the reviewer rounds `validating` counts after the
handoff.

The settled pair is the same rule one seam further on. A content update the
size gate holds is a round this stage finished and could not publish, and what
names it -- which of the four it was, and the head it produced -- is exactly
what a later tick cannot re-derive: the settlement publishes the commit, so the
resumed tick reads a branch that already carries its base and would call the
round a no-op flip.

The replay group is the same idea one seam further still: a record a tick
writes for a LATER tick to read, because what it says is destroyed by the very
step it describes.

One slot, one round. A resume that commits while a receipt is still outstanding
would write its own over it -- pushed, the owed round is cleared without ever
being counted; held, the gate writes over it -- so every road that starts one
yields until the owed round has been counted: the body edit at the door of the
handler, the human reply at the door of the rebase.
