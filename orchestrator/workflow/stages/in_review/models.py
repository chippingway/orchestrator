"""The records one in_review tick hands between its owners.

`_InReviewContext` is the tick itself. Every route below the handler needs the
same six handles, and the PR among them is the live one fetched once at the
top: re-reading it per route would let the mergeability answer and the head
SHA a ping is keyed on come from two different fetches. `pr_number` rides
along because the handler has already proven it is present -- the park for a
missing one happens before this record exists.

`_DriftResume` carries what the drift disposition cannot re-derive after the
run: the worktree the resume actually ran in (the resolve may have recreated
it), whether an operator paused mid-run, and `before_sha`, which is the only
thing that tells a pushed fix from a no-commit acknowledgement.
