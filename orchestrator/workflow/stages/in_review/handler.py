"""One in_review tick, in the order its questions have to be asked.

The terminals come first so an external human merge wins over anything this
stage would otherwise compute -- the PR landing is the answer to every
remaining question.

The fresh-feedback scan comes before the drift check, and the order is load
bearing rather than stylistic. `user_content_hash` covers the title, the body,
AND every human issue-thread comment, so a plain review comment moves it
exactly like a body edit does. Asking drift first would resume the dev and
bounce the issue to `validating` for a comment that should have recorded
`pending_fix_*` bookmarks and flipped to `fixing`, which is the documented
contract for issue-thread feedback on an open PR.

The missing-`pr_number` park is the one question asked before the context
exists: without a pinned PR there is nothing to fetch, and the stage refuses
to infer one -- the issue got here by a manual relabel, so a human relabels it
back.

    The handler always re-checks PR state (merged/closed) first so an external
    human merge wins over any orchestrator-side logic. Fresh actionable PR
    feedback on any of the four surfaces (issue thread, PR conversation,
    inline review, review summary) records pending-fix metadata in pinned
    state and flips the label to `fixing` immediately -- the dev resume and
    hand-back-to-`validating` cycle moves to the `fixing` handler. The
    orchestrator never merges from here: humans drive the merge. A
    mergeable PR whose current head completed the reviewer-approved
    final-docs handoff (or carries a real GitHub APPROVED review), with
    no standing human CHANGES_REQUESTED on that head, earns a one-shot
    HITL ping per head SHA so the human knows the PR is ready. An
    unmergeable PR parks awaiting human attention (no `resolving_conflict`
    route from this stage).

    User-content drift (a human edited the issue title/body while the PR
    was open) takes the dev-resume path here; both a pushed fix and a
    no-commit ACK bounce DIRECTLY back to `validating` (with
    `review_round` reset) so the reviewer re-evaluates against the
    updated body. Docs do not run on the drift exit: the single docs
    pass is deferred to the final-docs handoff after reviewer approval.
