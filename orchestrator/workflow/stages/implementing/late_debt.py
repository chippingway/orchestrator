"""An approval whose push never happened, paid before the stage runs.

The window the frozen pair cannot cover, one step past it. A candidate the

dies past that write leaves no record to reconcile from and an approval naming

pull request the work is not on, and the docs pass commits on top of a branch

    The commit is handed IN rather than read here, because the reading this

    decided about and the head it decided against. Both come off the approval,
    which is the only place either still exists.

    False is the debt paid -- the pull request carries the commit, the receipt
    is written, and the handler runs behind it over the same world the tick
