"""What a refusal costs, and the two sinks every one of them reaches.

One park shape for every reading the size gate could not take, because the
recovery is the same for all of them: the issue is handed back with the step
that failed named, the typed failure goes to the audit and analytics streams,
and a trusted bare `/orchestrator continue` re-reads rather than re-running
anything. The writes those steps ride out on are here too, since a park and a
persisted record are the two durable things this domain does.

What reaches those streams is the same three things the thread is told, and
for the same reason: the family says a reading did not happen, the member
beside it says which step stopped, and the line the step wrote says why. An
operator holding only the stream would otherwise have `measurement_failed` for
a remote that was throttling, a checkout that is gone, and a diff nothing can
pin, and no way to count one apart from the others.

Two of the steps a reading stops at get a bounded number of tries before that
happens, and they are the two that name the transport rather than the work: a
remote that would not answer for the base branch, and a fetch that did not
bring the base object back. Those clear themselves -- a network, a token, a
host that was down -- so the first few are counted on the record and nothing
else is done at all, and only a pair that has lost the last of them is worth a
human's attention. Every other member still parks on its first miss, because
re-reading a candidate this host does not hold or a diff nothing can pin buys
exactly the same answer.

Past ANY of those parks the pair is still read on every poll -- the
post-publication reconciliation takes that reading ahead of every handler --
and what those readings owe the thread is one sentence per thing there is to
say rather than one per poll. So the member a notice named is recorded, and it
is recorded by the roads that announce and by no other: a quiet miss tells
nobody anything, and a step written down by one would be a notice the guard
thinks was made. A reading stopping at the recorded member repeats a sentence
already on the issue and is held silently -- reported to the log and to both
sinks, said to no one. One stopping somewhere else is a different next move
for whoever is holding the issue, and nothing else would ever tell them, so it
is announced once and takes the recorded member's place.

What each member means to that person is spelled out here too. The vocabulary
is written for the code that branches on it, and a park that named only the
member would leave a human to work out for themselves whether they are looking
at a remote, a token, a checkout, or something planted in one.

    questions of it and a boolean would have to be renamed the first time a
    third road approved anything.

    `READING` is this gate's own count coming back at or below the ceiling.
    `UNMEASURED` is a publication that skipped the count on a record this
    workflow made for itself and can re-derive: a rewrite permit, a
    switched-off candidate, a receipt already on the remote. Each of those
    answers for its own bypass on the next tick, so nothing about the debt
    they leave has to be revalidated before it is spent.

    The other two are the ones an operator's authorization stands behind, and
    they are apart from `READING` for exactly that reason: an approval is
    spent by the tick that comes back after a crash, and one that RESTS on an
    authorization may only be spent while that authorization can still be
    read. `ADJUDICATION` is the publication debt an authorized settlement
    records beside the exemption it writes. `AUTHORIZATION` is the debt a
    candidate past the ceiling earns when an operator authorizes it at the
    gate itself -- the count behind it was this gate's own, so recording it as
    a reading would be true and useless: what let it through was the human,
    and a record damaged before the push would have it publish unmeasured.

    A value from anywhere else, and an approval an older binary wrote with no
    basis at all, read back as no basis -- and what a reader does with that is
    fall back to the exemption, which is the only evidence such a record left.

    The bounded road into the park above, taken by the two steps that reach a
    base rather than read one. It is bounded rather than absent because those
    steps clear themselves: a remote that would not answer and a fetch that
    brought nothing back are a network, a token, or a host that was down, and
    the next tick is very often the whole of the fix. Spending a human on the
    first of them spends them on something nobody had to do.

    So a miss inside the bound does exactly one thing -- it goes on the record
    -- and deliberately does nothing else: no `awaiting_human`, no reason, and
    no comment, which leaves the pinned pair exactly as a retry finds it and
    lets the next tick re-enter that same pair on both roads with no agent
    behind it. Past the bound the ordinary park takes it, because a base still
    unreachable that many readings later is not one this process is going to
    reach, and committed work is waiting behind a reading that will not
    happen.

    The count goes down BEFORE anything is reported or said, and that order is
    the bound itself: every tick is a fresh process, so a miss lost to a crash
    in that window is a miss nothing remembers -- and a retry that cannot
    remember is not bounded at all. What is written always names a candidate,
    since both callers reach here holding the pair they froze.

    A park this owner already took OVER THIS PAIR ends the counting outright:
    the bound is spent, the human it asked has been asked, and the reading is
    retried each tick only so the transport coming back settles it without
    one. The reading is still reported, and whether it is also SAID is the
    announce-once guard above rather than this road's: a step that park
    already named is a repeat, and one it did not is a notice nobody has made.
    What clears the park is a reading that succeeds, or the human's own bare
    continue, which drops the reason before the gate is entered and so buys
    exactly one more counted attempt.

    The member that goes on the record is the one a notice NAMED, and the
    reading that spends the bound writes it in the same write as the count:
    the two are one fact -- this reading ran the retries out and is about to
    be said -- so a crash between them would leave a mention nothing could
    tell from a repeat. A quiet miss writes only the count, because it says
    nothing to anybody: the step it stopped at recorded there would be a
    notice the guard thinks was made, and the miss that finally spends the
    bound would find its own step already down and hand the issue over
    without a word.

    A park standing over some OTHER pair is a spent one, and it is retired
    here rather than obeyed. The commonest way to reach one is the opposite
    reply to that continue: a human answers the park with guidance, the
    developer is resumed, and what it commits is a fresh candidate this park
    was never about. Read as this pair's, the miss over that new commit would
    be dropped on the floor -- nothing persisted, nothing reported, and the

    pays for. A record carrying a number has been answered -- the routed hold
    that carries it spent this on the way past -- and rewriting it there would
    leave a spent claim on the comment for a later reader to apply twice.

    A measurement park the new record moves PAST goes out in this same write,
    because the two are read as one afterwards: a later tick asks whether the
    park standing is the one this pair was parked for, and answers by
    comparing it against the recorded candidate. Left to the verdict alone,
    the window between this write and that one is a crash away from a park
    taken over one commit sitting beside a record naming another -- which the
    next tick reads as that pair's own, holding every later reading of it
    silently, counting none of them, and never reaching the notice a human is
    owed. Bound here, the comment can never say two things at once.

    real words is guidance, which belongs to the ordinary resume that feeds it

    write in. A bare continue landing there is in a later road's batch and in
    nobody else's, and both of the roads behind this one would SPEND it: the
    parked-continue classifier reads a command on a park that is not a session
    failure as one carrying no answer, refuses it, and consumes the thread
    past its own refusal; the generic resume reads it as guidance, pays for a
    developer to answer it, and consumes it too. Either way the operator's
    retry is gone and the reading they asked for is one nothing will ever
    take.

    So while this park stands, a batch this road would act on belongs to it,

    reply. A watermark is one number and neither of them is the last thing to
    move it: the run a resume starts parks, and that park stamps the thread
    read to the notice it posts, which lands above the command and takes it.
    Deferred entire, nothing is lost -- the next poll reads the same batch and
    re-measures the pair on it.

    ALL of them, which is this park's own rule rather than the last-reply one
    the authorization command is read by. A reading is retried by a reply that
    asks for nothing else; a batch carrying real words is guidance, and the
    ordinary resume feeding it to the developer is exactly what it is owed.

    Asked only while the park is standing, and only of a batch read the way
    this owner reads one. A comment of ours above the watermark is in that

    defer what the road it deferred to then refuses, and the two would hand
