"""The one reply a park for an authorization is ever ended by.

Reading a thread, and nothing else: no record is written here and nothing is
decided. What this owner answers is which comment -- if any -- the tick behind
it should act on, so the road that acts has one fact to act on rather than a
conversation to interpret.

The LAST fresh trusted reply decides, and reading it any other way poisons the
park. Guidance written after a command outranks it, since the safe reading of
somebody who asked to publish and then asked for a change is the one that
publishes nothing; a command written after guidance is the decision that
replaced it. Read as a SET instead, a reply that matches nothing would never
be consumed on the seams that publish onto a pull request the remote already
carries -- nothing there moves the watermark by any other means -- so it would
stand in every later batch and refuse the correct command behind it forever.

A reply that IS the command is carried whatever it goes on to say, including
an argument nobody could act on. That is what earns an abbreviation the
sentence saying so instead of a silent park: the empty id can never equal a
candidate, so it takes the refusal road by itself.

Three authors are never in the reading at all. An outsider's comment cannot
authorize anything, which is the allowlist's rule applied where the thread is
read. The orchestrator's own comments are nobody's decision -- and the park
notice spells the command out ready to copy, so our sentences are exactly what
a reader matching on that syntax would mistake for one. And a comment with no
id is neither: a record made from it would name a comment nothing can locate,
which is the one thing an authorization may not be.

Being ours is PROVED rather than read off a comment, because the last-reply
rule makes dropping one the same act as deleting what its author said. A
retraction taken for one of ours is a retraction that never happened, and the
authorization under it becomes the last word and publishes -- consent
withdrawn and acted on anyway. So the ledger of ids this process recorded
posting is the whole of the evidence: the marker is text anybody may paste,
and the author login is a token this repository says outright may be shared
with the human whose consent this park collects. A comment the ledger cannot
vouch for stays in the reading and, not being the command, leaves the park
standing.

    Only the LAST fresh reply is read, and that is the whole of the rule.
    Every earlier one has been superseded by it: an operator who names one
    commit and then another has decided about the second, and one who writes
    guidance and then the command has changed their mind toward publishing.
    Reading the batch as a set instead is what poisons a park -- a reply that
    matches nothing is never consumed on the seams that publish onto a pull
    request the remote already carries, so it would stand in every later batch
    and refuse a correct command forever.

    `named` is the commit that reply authorizes, whole or EMPTY. Empty is a
    command nobody could act on -- an abbreviation, or an argument that is not
    an object id at all, since nothing in this domain abbreviates -- and it is
    carried rather than dropped: it can never equal the candidate, so it takes
    the refusal road and the human gets the sentence and the command that
    would have worked. `comment_id` is the reply itself, which is the address
    a recorded authorization is attributable to.

    `watermark` is how far the READING got, which is a different fact from
    either: the furthest comment this owner actually looked at, ours and
    untrusted ones included. It travels because it is what an answer may
    consume and no more. A tick that read the tip of the thread and then
    consumed past whatever the tip has become would swallow a retraction
    posted in between -- unread, unanswered, and gone for good, while the
    authorization it was retracting published. Consumed to what was read, the
    retraction is still there for the next poll.

        sentence lands above the reply it answers and has to be consumed --
        left behind, the next poll reads the orchestrator's own words as
        somebody's fresh guidance and resumes a developer against them.

        Reached by its id alone, though, it would pay for that with the one

    the watermark moves past it, so the park goes on standing over a decision
    nothing can ever read again -- and a second developer is paid for over an
    implementation that is committed already.

    Bounding the batch by what the classifying road READ would not close it,

    matching on that syntax would otherwise mistake for one.

    Which makes the standard of proof the whole question, because dropping a
    comment here is not a neutral act. The reading behind this takes the LAST
    fresh reply, so a comment dropped is a comment whose author never spoke:
    an operator who authorizes a candidate and then retracts it would have the
    retraction removed and the authorization selected, and the candidate would
    publish on consent that had been withdrawn. Over-filtering is how this
    park publishes something nobody agreed to.

    evidence. It is a fact about what this process DID, and nothing a
    commenter writes can put itself into it.

    Neither of the other two signals may stand in for it, and both are
    refused rather than accepted as a weaker second best. The marker is plain
    text in a public thread that anybody may paste, or quote off a comment of
    ours that carries one. And the author login is the shared-PAT hazard this
    repository already names where that ledger is defined: the token belongs
    to a human, so a reviewer posting from the same account matches it
    exactly, and a retraction they wrote under a quoted marker would be read
    as the orchestrator talking to itself. The two together are no better,
    since the human who shares the login is the one whose consent this park
    exists to collect.

    Anything the ledger cannot vouch for is somebody's word and stays in the

    standing as the last reply, which is not the command, so the park goes on

    can answer, and it is the one this owner fails in.
