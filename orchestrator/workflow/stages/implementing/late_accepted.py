    """Push a commit an adjudication accepted onto the publication it names.

    No measurement, because there is nothing left to measure: a human read
    this exact diff and said it ships as one change, and the record that said
    so is what the approval beside it came from. What the push still owes is
    the two things every gated one owes -- it publishes the commit that was
    decided rather than whatever the checkout became, and it is pinned to the
    head the reading was taken over, so a pull request somebody moved while
    the adjudication was open rejects it instead of being overwritten.

    What it does NOT skip is the checkout. An adjudication is a human reading
    a diff over hours or days, and the worktree is writable the whole time: an
    operator can commit in it, an agent from another stage can be resumed over
    it, a rebase can move it. So the same two proofs every publication takes
    are taken here -- the tree is provably clean, and `HEAD` is still the
    commit that was accepted -- because what a verdict licenses is one commit
    and only it. A push named against the approved id would put the right
    commit on the remote either way, and that is precisely the danger: every
    stage past this one works from the CHECKOUT, so one left on an unmeasured
    descendant reaches review, a squash, and a merge with nobody having read
    it.

    The window this proof cannot cover is the push itself, and the settlement
    takes `_standing_on` again on the far side of it for that reason -- there
    rather than here, because the same reading is owed by the retry that
    finds the push already landed and makes none of its own.

    The lease is required rather than defaulted, for the same reason: nothing
    measures this candidate again, so the head the record names is the whole
    of what stops the push landing on a pull request somebody moved while the
    adjudication was open.

    False is a refusal or a push that did not land, and the caller parks for
    both: the approval and its lease are still on the record, so the retry
    asks for the same commit against the same head once the checkout is back
    where the verdict left it.

    The settlement rides the same call the gated tail makes, so a permission
    a rewrite left standing is answered here too -- and it is answered with no
    permit behind it, deliberately: nothing on this road asks `late_transfer`
    anything, so what it may do is drop a permission this publication has gone
    PAST and never carry a verdict over. A permit granted for some other
    object is one the remote will never stand where it accounts for again;
    one granted for the commit in hand is left where it stands for the tick
    that re-asks it.
