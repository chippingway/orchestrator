"""Deciding what one implementing tick actually runs, if anything.

The first question is not which prompt to build -- it is whether the issue is
parked. An awaiting-human tick belongs to the human's reply (or to the quiet
timeout recovery); only an unparked one is allowed to spawn.

An unparked tick still has a shortcut before the agent: a worktree that already
carries commits is a previous run whose publication was interrupted, so the
recovered result is synthesized and the commits are pushed rather than
implemented again. Neither road is taken on an issue that still owes a push
for a commit the size gate approved: that commit is what the tick is about,
so it publishes from a checkout standing on it and parks for the worktree
otherwise -- because the ahead-of-base question the shortcut asks re-decides a
settled one, and the spawn would buy a second developer run for an
implementation that is already written. The one issue the shortcut is not
true of is one a read-only relabel just let through
-- a discussion may be held on the branch its PR is open against, so the
commits there predate this stage entirely, and the guard records the tip it
certified for exactly this read. Then the retry budget
gates the spawn -- retiring the pinned session where a continuation is what
paid for it, since what a human bought is a fresh conversation and the run
records an id of its own only when the backend hands one back -- and the
agent spec is
persisted BEFORE the run -- so a spawn that commits but returns no session id
still leaves the durable role identity behind and a later `DEV_AGENT` flip
cannot retarget the next resume at a backend that never ran on this issue.

`before_sha` is captured on every path, including the shortcut, because the
disposition downstream distinguishes a commit produced by THIS run from
carried-over work by comparing against it. The branch is persisted on every
prepared run for the same reason: whatever the next tick resolves has to be the
branch this one worked on.

    that granted it. A process that dies in between comes back to an unparked

    its own (`_spawn_implementer` records one only when the backend returns
    it), and the next ordinary reply resumes the conversation the cap
    stopped.

    "Ahead of base" is the whole test for an issue that reached this stage the

    means a run committed and died before its publication. It is not the test
    for an issue a read-only relabel let through, because those are allowed to

    guard certified them, recording the tip it vouched for, and reading them

    The baseline is spent as soon as it stops describing the branch: once the
    dev commits, HEAD moves off it and every later tick is judged the ordinary
    way again.

    Which makes that a COMPARISON, and a comparison whose head could not be
    read establishes nothing. `_head_sha` reports its own failure as "", so an
    unread checkout arrives here differing from the certified tip exactly as a
    checkout the dev has committed on does -- and read that way the baseline
    is spent, the implementer is skipped, and the design's predecessor is

    stands until something shows the branch has moved off it. The road with no
