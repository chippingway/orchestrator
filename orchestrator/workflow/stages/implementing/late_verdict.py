"""What a measured candidate earns, and what the record owes on the way.

Three endings and the retirement they share. A candidate at or below the
ceiling publishes, one past it is held under the adjudication label, and a
record the publication is going past is dropped -- durably, before the effects
it licenses, because the write that ends a generation has to land ahead of the
label that hands the issue on.

Which leaves a gap the same write has to fill. Between a retirement and the
push it licenses there is committed work on the branch and, without this,
nothing on the issue saying which commit it is -- so the commit a publication
is owed goes down beside the retirement and is spent by the handoff that
carries it. An adjudication takes it back off: a candidate being decomposed is
one nobody is publishing yet.

    The write is the point, and it is one the caller cannot defer. What

    request, and moves the label to `workflow:validating` -- and the pinned
    write that would have carried the retirement comes after all of it. A tick
    that died in that window would leave a published pull request under
    `validating` over a generation that still says `measuring`: the branch
    frozen out of the base refresh for good, and a close on that issue read by

    pinned write per candidate that publishes; what it buys is that no window
    exists in which the issue has moved on and its record has not.

    True is the answer that stops the publication: a close ended this cycle
    instead, so nothing may be pushed, opened, or handed to review on an issue
    nobody wants. It is asked in the two places a retirement can lose one. The
    latch is one -- a poll observed the close and could hand the reading to no

    is the other and the subtler: it takes the cycle identity off the record,
    and everything that decides what a close is worth reads that identity, so
    a poll landing inside it finds an issue with nothing to end and drops the
    observation. The window advertises the cycle for exactly as long as the
    write runs, and what it saw is decided as it closes -- under the lock that
    closes it, so no interval is left for a reading to arrive unreported.

    A reading the window caught is answered by putting the generation BACK.

    it goes back exactly as it was and is cancelled from there, so what the

    What the route still owes rides the same write, because the recovery has
    no run behind it to re-derive a reviewer round, a consumed fix batch, or a
    docs receipt from. The debt and the obligations are spent together by the
    push that pays them.

    A debt this issue ALREADY carries for the commit is left exactly as it
    is. It was granted by an earlier tick against a head that tick froze, and
    the head read now is precisely the move its lease exists to refuse -- so

    already closed. A call taken before anything was published names no head
    at all, and the initial publication owns that window itself.

    The lease is handed IN rather than read off the entry, because the entry
    is not the only road to one. Where the switch keeps a candidate out of the
