"""Why a run that produced no publishable commit stopped, and what that costs.

A commit-less run reaches exactly one of four parks, and the difference
between them is not cosmetic: `park_reason` is the field
`/orchestrator continue` keys off. A quota notice, a provider that refused to
serve the turn, and an empty result are all tagged `agent_silent` -- retryable
session failures an operator can continue once the other side is back -- and
all advance the silent-park streak that eventually rotates a poisoned session
to a fresh spawn. What makes the first two worth separating from a real
question is that both arrive as ORDINARY non-empty final messages: the text
the CLI hands back is the refusal, not the agent's words, so the field a
question is read off says nothing about the run. A real question is the
opposite: it clears the reason and zeroes the streak, because it needs a
human's words before anything should run again, and a stale transient reason
left behind would let a later tick auto-recover over a question nobody
answered.

The dirty-worktree park is the fifth, and it exists to refuse a push rather
than to explain a failure: the branch would omit the uncommitted files, so the
PR would not match what the agent produced. A tree nothing could READ is that
same refusal with the other half missing -- `git status` failing, or an index
entry git was told to stop comparing, establishes nothing about what the
checkout carries -- and it is its own park because what an operator has to fix
there is a repository rather than a file list. Every park here posts the HITL
comment, ratchets `last_action_comment_id` past it so the next tick reads the
human's reply and not its own notice, and emits `park_awaiting_human` -- but
leaves the pinned-state write to the handler, so the park composes with
whatever else that tick staged.
