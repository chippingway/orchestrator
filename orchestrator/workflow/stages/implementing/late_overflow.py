"""The publication a gate call taken PAST the first push is entered on.

The same gate one seam further on. A developer resumed on review feedback, on a
human's comment, or on an edited issue body; a commit an earlier park stranded;
a deferred push or one a timeout killed the disposition before it saw; a
conflict resolution; a base refresh; a final documentation pass. Each of them
puts a commit on a checkout a pull request was opened from, and what the push
that follows produces is not that commit's own diff -- it is everything the
pull request comes to with the commit in it.

Nothing about the measurement, the record, or the verdict is this owner's, and
neither is the push: `late_gate` beside it is the order the size questions are
asked in and answers them the same way for both seams, and `late_push` spends
what it hands back. What is HERE is the entry -- the three facts a call taken
past publication has that one taken before it does not, and the refusals that
make freezing them fail closed rather than open.

The entry is frozen BEFORE any effect and travels with the record because a
reconciliation could re-derive none of it. The stage is gone the moment the
adjudication label replaces it. The pull request is the one the work already
has, and it is recorded here rather than read back off the hold beside it: that
record names whichever pull request the cycle marked, which is this one only
because this entry named it first. And the head is the tip that pull request
was left standing on, which the next push to the branch moves. Recorded, a
later tick can say which publication a generation was entered on; re-read, it
would answer with whatever the issue has become.

Five readings refuse rather than report, and each of them is a push this gate
would otherwise wave through on evidence nobody took. A tree that is not
PROVABLY clean is one whose diff is not the diff a push would publish -- and a
`git status` that established nothing names no paths, which is what a clean
tree names too. A pull request nothing could read, or one that is closed or
merged, is not a publication a measurement means anything against -- and all
three of those readings are taken inside one refusal, since a fetched pull
request is a lazy object and the requests that fail are the attribute accesses
behind the lookup. A head the CALLER named that is no whole object id, or that
is not the head this pull request is standing on, is a disagreement between
two readings of one fact rather than a choice between them: preferring either
would freeze a tip the branch would not be pushed onto. And a head that has
MOVED off what a live record froze is somebody else's push landing between the
freeze and this tick: the frozen pair no longer describes what this branch
would add to that pull request, so the reading is refused and the record is
left standing rather than re-entered over a publication it was never taken on.

    Read in the order the refusals matter in, so a park names the first thing
    that was missing rather than a later step standing in for it. The tree
    comes first because it is the cheapest and the one that invalidates every
    reading behind it: a candidate measured beside uncommitted changes is not
    the candidate a push would publish, and a `git status` that established
    nothing is not a clean tree either. Then the stage, then the pull request
    and the head on it.

    Two of the three are the CALLER's where it has them, and both for the same
    reason: a fact this owner would re-read is a fact that can have moved
    since the caller acted on it.

    The stage, because the label is a cached object. A route that relabels
    remotely and then publishes in the same tick -- the reviewer's
    `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, which flips to `fixing` before the dev spawn -- reads
    back the label it was fetched with, so a record built from it would name
    the state the issue has LEFT and a settled verdict would continue there.
    Whatever the caller names is still checked, and against the exact
    predicate rather than the transition graph: the five states that publish
    onto a pull request the remote already carries, not every label with an
    edge to the adjudication. `ready`, `blocked`, and `umbrella` each have one
    for reasons of their own and no pull request behind any of them, and
    `implementing`'s own push is what OPENS the pull request -- so an entry
    frozen from one of those would record a group a later reconciliation
    measures and pushes on a stage that never committed the candidate.

    The head, because a caller that established one has already decided on it.
    The conflict and base-sync publications each read the remote themselves
    and pin their push to what they read; freezing anything else would leave
    the immediate push refusing a head that moved while a later one -- a
    settled adjudication's -- pinned to the head that moved and overwrote it.
    What is frozen is what the push will be pinned against, so both roads fail

    A caller naming the head it began at is claiming the publication has not
    moved since, and there is one move that is not somebody else's: this
    issue's OWN push having landed. A tick that pushed and died before its
    record went down comes back to a pull request standing on the very commit
    it was about, and refusing that as a disagreement would stop the
    reconciliation that exists to finish it -- for a remote that is exactly
    where this issue put it.

    Three ways to be that commit, and every one of them is a DURABLE record
    of a push this workflow decided on or made -- which is the whole of what
    makes the carve-out safe. Two stand alone: the commit an approval says is
    still owed a push, and the pair a frozen record is being reconciled
    against. An approval is dropped by the write that pays it and a generation
    is retired by the write that approves it, so neither outlives the window
    it describes.

    The caller's own candidate is deliberately NOT among them. It is a commit
    this tick read off a checkout a moment ago, and it says nothing about how
    the remote came to be standing on it: on a fresh attempt no push of this
    workflow's has run at all, so a pull request that moved from the head the
    caller began at onto the candidate moved because something ELSE put it
    there -- an agent that pushed its own commit is the plain case -- and
    waving it through would measure and route the very candidate this gate
    exists to hold back. The one thing that tells the two apart is a record,
    and the caller does not have one.

    The publication receipt is the record that does, and it is admitted only
    with the head it REPLACED beside it. Alone it would be no evidence: it is
    the last commit this stage put on the remote and is never cleared, so a
    pull request a rewrite or a revert moved BACK onto a commit published
    rounds ago would read as this tick's own push having landed -- and a
    checkout standing on that same commit is not evidence either, since a
    rewind can put the branch and the pull request back on it together. What
    dates a receipt to THIS attempt is the head it was pinned to: a push made
    from the head this call was entered on, which is one the caller froze and
    a rewind cannot supply. Matched, the window is exactly the one it exists
    for -- a push that landed and a process that died before the relabel
    behind it -- and a receipt naming any other head answers for nothing.

    land, so a count against it would adjudicate a question nobody can act on.

    The head is the caller's where it established one, and it is CHECKED
    against this read rather than substituted for it. Both are whole object
