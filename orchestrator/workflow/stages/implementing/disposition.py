"""What a finished dev run leaves behind, and the timeout's second chance.

`before_sha` -- the pre-agent HEAD -- is what these four share. A timed-out run
is not automatically a failure: the implementer can commit clean work and then
be killed by the timeout, or a descendant can finish the commit during cleanup,
so the disposition asks whether HEAD MOVED rather than whether the run exited
well. `_has_new_commits` cannot answer that (it compares against
`origin/<base>`, so carried-over commits from an earlier tick look identical),
which is the whole reason the watermark is threaded this far.

Neither reading answers it alone, and both of the timeout's readers are where
that costs something. A watermark difference says the checkout moved and not
what it moved TO: a run that timed out having committed nothing leaves a
branch with nothing ahead of base, so anything that advances the checkout onto
that base -- an agent rebasing or resetting mid-run, the refresh between two
ticks -- produces the difference with no developer having written a line. So
the disposition and the recovery both ask both questions -- the head is not
where the run started, AND the branch carries something the base does not --
and publish only where both hold.

When HEAD did not move, the park persists that same watermark as
`pre_implement_sha`, and that is why the recovery lives here rather than beside
the other preflight checks: it is the only reader of what the park wrote, and it
republishes through the normal commit path -- the ":sparkles: PR opened" comment
included -- because publishing the branch IS the recovery. It must never spawn
an agent, and it stays parked on anything it cannot vouch for: a reaped
worktree, a tree that is dirty or that nothing could read, a watermark that
names no commit, an unmoved HEAD, or a head standing on a base this branch
adds nothing to.

Both dispositions route a committed worktree through one place, so a dirty tree
refuses the push identically whether it came from a clean exit, a timeout, or a
drift resume -- and so does an oversized one. That single seam is where the
size gate beside this owner runs, which is what lets one measurement stand
between every clean committed candidate and the branch it would be published
on. The park it takes when a candidate cannot be measured has a recovery of
its own here, for the reason the timeout's does: it is the only reader of what
that park wrote, and what it owes a human is another reading rather than
another agent.

    A clean tree pushes/opens the PR via `_on_commits`; a tree with
    uncommitted edits parks via `_on_dirty_worktree` (pushing would publish a
    branch that omits the dirty files). Shared by the fresh-completion, timeout,
    and user-content-drift dispositions so each handles a committed worktree
    identically.

    Clean is PROVED here rather than inferred from an empty answer. The list
    form of the status read maps its own failure to "no paths", which is the
    right shape for a caller refusing on what git DID name and the wrong one
    for this caller: what follows is a push, so a reading that never happened
    would publish a branch nobody could show matched the work. The status form
    keeps the two apart, and both halves of "not provably clean" park.

    Reaching here retires the read-only baseline. It named the tip a handoff
    was certified at so a run that committed nothing could be told from one
    that did, and there is committed work here either way -- while a baseline
    left behind would go on freezing this branch out of the base refresh long
    after the stage that needed it still holds the issue.

    The size gate sits between the two, and only a CLEAN tree reaches it: a
    candidate measured beside uncommitted changes is not the candidate a push
    would publish, and the diff it would be adjudicated on is not the one a
    human would read. Being the one seam all three dispositions publish
    through is what makes the gate a contract rather than a check -- an
    oversized candidate is held here whether it came from a clean exit, a
    timeout that committed first, or a branch a crash stranded.

    What the gate hands back is the COMMIT it let through, not merely its
    permission, and the push is named against it. Between the reading and the
    write another tick, an operator, or a descendant the timeout cleanup
    raced can move `HEAD` -- and a push that named nothing would publish
    whatever it had become, while the record named the commit that passed.

    A `_RecoveredWork` says this call is answering a reading a previous tick
    recorded rather than disposing what a run just produced. No developer ran
    on those paths, so the switch's bypass and a head that moved both mean
    something different there, and the gate is told which kind of tick it is
    by the work it is handed rather than left to guess from a checkout that
    cannot say.

    Ahead-of-base answers this for every issue that reached the stage the
    ordinary way: it spawns only on a branch carrying nothing, so commits found
    afterwards are the run's. Two states break that assumption, and each leaves
    a floor behind for exactly this reading.

    A branch a read-only relabel certified and handed on was already ahead of
    base when the agent started, and `read_only_baseline_sha` names the tip it
    vouched for. A candidate the size gate froze is the same shape one step
    later: the park it took leaves committed work on the branch, and the
    developer a human's guidance resumes runs on top of it. HEAD still sitting
    on either floor means the only commits present are the ones that were
    already there -- and an agent that came back with a clarifying question
    rather than an implementation would otherwise have that work pushed, a PR
    opened over it, and the issue routed to review instead of parking on the
    question it asked. Worse for the frozen one: the work published that way
    is the very candidate whose size nobody could read.

    The RUN's own watermark is asked beside the floor, and it is the half
    that catches a resumed developer. The floor says which tip the branch
    inherited; `before_sha` says which tip this run started from, and those
    are different commits whenever a human's guidance resumed a developer on
    top of inherited work -- most sharply after a handoff refused a checkout
    sitting on a descendant of the approved commit. A head that has not moved
    since the run began is a run that committed nothing, whatever else is on
    the branch, so publishing there would push the very commit the guidance
    was asked ABOUT and drop the question the developer came back with.

    It is asked whether or not a floor exists, because the state with no
    floor at all is one of the ways to reach exactly that: a size reading
    that failed before it could freeze a candidate leaves a park and no
    record, and the guidance answering it resumes a developer on a branch
    that already carries commits nothing on the issue names. The floor is
    still asked first where there is one -- it is the narrower claim, and a
    head sitting on it is carried-over work even where this run did move the
    head onto it.

    Both questions are comparisons, so both ends have to have been READ, and
    a run neither end can be established for publishes nothing. That is what
    `_attributable_run` refuses on, and a recovered run is the one road past
    it -- it is defined by commits that predate the tick, so there is no run
    here to attribute anything to.

    Both dispositions decide by COMPARING two tips -- where the run began and
    where it ended -- so a comparison missing an end is not a weaker answer,
    it is no answer. `_head_sha` reports its own failure as "", which is the
    one value that cannot be a commit, so an unread end reaches here looking
    exactly like a checkout with nothing on it.

    Published on that, the difference is decided by whichever end DID read: a
    run whose starting tip could not be read differs from every head there is,
    and a run whose ending tip could not be read differs from every watermark.

    that committed nothing publishes the commits it was asked ABOUT, with the
    question it came back with dropped, or hands the size gate a candidate
    nobody made.

    Which is why the failed probe parks rather than publishes here, though it
    parks a finished run's commits behind a reading nobody got. That cost is
    bounded and visible: the commit is still in the worktree, the branch is
    untouched, and the park says so. The other way round is neither -- what

    The timeout's half of the question `_run_left_commits` answers for a

    same reason: ahead-of-base says the branch carries something the base
    does not, and the watermark says THIS run is what put it there. Either
    alone publishes work nobody made.

    Ahead-of-base is the reading a killed run cannot do without. A timeout
    that produced no commit leaves the branch exactly where the run started,
    so anything that moves the checkout without committing -- an agent that
    rebased or reset onto a base that advanced under it, a `git pull` in its
    own tooling, another process touching the worktree across an hour-long
    run -- moves the head with nothing written. Read as a difference alone
    that is a commit to publish, and what goes out is the base branch: a push,
    a pull request with no diff in it, and the issue handed to review under
    this issue's name.

    The watermark is the reading it cannot do without either, and it is why
    ahead-of-base is not simply substituted for it: a branch can arrive at
    this stage already ahead of base -- a read-only relabel hands one over,
    and a size-gate park leaves committed work a resumed developer runs on
    top of -- so the base comparison alone would publish carried-over work as
    a killed run's own.

    An end that could not be read at all fails the comparison outright, on
    the same terms the clean half now refuses it: a tip nobody established is
    not a tip, and both ends of this one can fail -- the pre-agent read that
    became `before_sha`, and the post-run read taken here. Either missing
    makes the difference an artefact of the probe rather than of the run, and
    on a branch that was already ahead of base that difference publishes work
    the run never made.
