"""Keeping an accepted plan handoff in step with its PR until a dev pushes.

The handoff is written before the developer runs, and everything the tick
stages after it is dropped by an interruption on purpose -- so the window
between that write and the first dev commit is one a crash, a restart or a live
pause can leave an issue sitting in for polls at a time. The humans still have
the design on an open pull request through all of it, and what they do to it
there is exactly what the handoff existed to take account of.

Nothing was left watching. `discussion_plan_path` is retired by that write, so
plan identity falls to the recorded commit against the PR's live head -- and an
amendment made in this window moves that head, which reads as this stage having
pushed: merged, the issue is closed `done` with no developer having run, and
unmerged the developer is spawned on the checkout the handoff left, whose push
takes the amendment back out. A merge alone is enough to matter even with
nothing amended, since the baseline freezes base sync and the developer would
start behind a base the plan has just landed in.

So the handoff's own record is read as the state it is: `read_only_baseline_sha`
beside `discussion_plan_sha` says a relabel was accepted and this stage has
published nothing since. While it stands, the reading the guard took once is
taken again -- the same PR read, the same re-anchor onto what it carries, the
same two records written -- and the tick then continues to a developer starting
where its reviewers left off.

What ends it is the branch, because the branch is the only durable record of a
developer having committed: pinned state written after a push is lost by the
same crash this exists for. A tip nothing could read is not that answer -- it is
no answer -- and the tick holds rather than deciding the plan question on a
reading nobody took.

A tip past the baseline is not that answer on its own, though, because the
re-anchor here moves the branch BEFORE it records where it put it. A tick that
dies in between leaves the branch on the plan PR's live head with the older
commit still recorded -- indistinguishable, by the branch alone, from a
developer having committed. Read that way, the next tick hands the reviewers'
own amendment to the recovered-work shortcut, which skips the agent and
publishes their edit as the implementation. So the move writes a marker of its
own before it makes it, and a marker still standing says the branch is where
this stage put it and nothing has been published from here.

    The same three answers the relabel guard has. A PR that could not be read
    decides nothing and ends the tick; a head that could not be put on the
    branch holds the handoff where it is rather than spawning a developer
    behind the reviewers; and anything else records what the branch really
    ended up on.

    A MERGED plan is re-anchored even when its head has not moved, because what
    the developer starts from is the base by then and the base moves on its own
    -- the design landed in it, and so has everything else that landed since.
    Only a reading that changes neither record writes nothing, which is the
    ordinary poll of a handoff nobody has touched.

    The marker is what makes the move itself recoverable, and it is durable
    before the ref is touched for the same reason the publication's is:
    everything after that point can leave the world changed, and the branch it
    leaves behind is one the next tick has to be able to recognize as this
    stage's rather than as a developer's work to publish. It is retired by the
    write that says where the branch ended up, so the two are never both true
