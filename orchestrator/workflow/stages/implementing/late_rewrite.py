"""The push a squash-on-approval makes over the branch it just rewrote.

The tenth seam that publishes onto a pull request the remote already carries,
and it goes through the whole gate like the other nine. What it publishes is a
NEW object: a squash collapses the approved commits into one commit that did
not exist when any earlier push was measured, so that commit is the candidate
-- proved, frozen against the base the remote names now, counted, and either
pushed or held. Measuring the head it replaces instead would gate one commit
and publish another.

The count it earns is ordinarily the count the last gated push already
answered, because the tree is the same tree. Ordinarily is not always: the
BASE moves, and a base that advanced since that push changes what this branch
adds to it. That is the reading this seam exists to take -- it is the last
push before a human is asked to merge, so a pull request that has crossed the
ceiling since anyone looked would otherwise reach the merge button
unadjudicated.

A candidate the RECORD names ends the tick without a rollback. Past the
ceiling the gate has moved the issue to `workflow:decomposing` and a settled
`single` verdict publishes the squash from the branch; short of a count the
pair is one the reconciliation ahead of the next handler owes a reading, and
that reading can only be taken in the checkout it was frozen on. Either way
restoring the pre-squash head would leave a record naming a commit this branch
no longer has -- adjudicated over a commit nobody has, or refused by every
later tick as a candidate that moved. The same holds for a push that landed
and for a checkout something committed over: in each the squash is somebody's
and a reset is the destructive step.

A REFUSED one is the opposite and is told apart from all of them, because the
squash there is a local commit nobody measured, nobody published, and nothing
recorded -- an entry that could not prove itself deliberately persists none.
Left on the branch it is the ONE commit a retry finds, which takes the
nothing-to-squash road and reports success without measuring or pushing
anything -- so the approved work reaches the merge button neither counted nor
on the remote. `_rewrite_stands` is what the caller asks before it decides.

The entry is asked TWICE, and the first time is not redundant. A pull request
nothing could read, one a human closed mid-review, a dirty tree, or a head
that moved out from under the reading are all answerable while the branch is
still intact, and asking them there is what keeps a doomed publication from
costing a rewrite and a rollback to learn about. Closing a pull request does
not move its branch, so that first reading is also the only thing standing
between a `--force-with-lease` and a publication nobody can merge.

What the squash also carries into the gate is the before-state it destroyed.
The head the pull request was standing on, the merge base the plan was
collapsed onto, and the commit that came out are the whole of the evidence
`late_transfer` grants a transfer on -- so a squash of the exact commit an
adjudication accepted can be recognized as the same contribution rather than
measured past the same ceiling and adjudicated a second time. Nothing here
decides that; what this owner owes it is the pair of pairs, taken before the
reset, that no reading past the rewrite could produce. The rollback is the
other end of the same obligation: a push the remote refuses puts the branch
back onto the commit the exemption never left -- the grant records a
PERMISSION and moves nothing, and only the receipt of a landed push spends it
-- so what the reset owes is dropping the permission it will never spend.

The before-state is said out loud first, and that is what makes the rotation
recoverable at all. The rewrite destroys the only evidence of what it was
about, so the head it is collapsing, the base it is collapsing over, and how
many commits go in go onto the pinned comment BEFORE the reset -- and a tick
that comes back to a one-commit branch reads them rather than guessing. What
it does with them is resume: the same leased publication the squash would have
made, entered on the head this collapse accounts for, handed the same
before-state, and finished with the count only the record still holds. Nothing
is squashed again, and an already-landed one is finished as the leased no-op
it is rather than remeasured or readjudicated.

    comes back to a record still standing over a branch the recovery reads
    again and answers the same way -- an already-published collapse is
    finished a second time as the leased no-op it is, and an untouched branch
    is squashed afresh.

    Taken over the pinned STATE rather than over a gate, because the owner
    that finally drops one is the stage handoff, which has no candidate to
    build a gate around: past the push there is nothing left to decide about.
