"""What a relabeled issue is carrying that no conversation stage vouched for.

Which way a relabel out of `question` or `discussion` goes is decided by the
worktree and the branch, never by the park reason alone. A misbehaving run can
park having committed or dirtied the per-issue branch, and dropping the park
would let the fresh-spawn path's recovered-worktree shortcut push that work as
a dev implementation. The branch is checked even when the worktree is gone,
because a safe teardown (or an operator) can remove the directory while the
local branch survives carrying those commits -- `_ensure_worktree` would
restore it and the shortcut would ship them.

The checkout is read for its own HEAD for the mirror-image reason. A commit does
not have to be on a branch anybody here names: an agent that committed while
detached leaves every ref where it was and the plan sitting in the tree, which
is exactly what the creators keep and the shortcut pushes. So the branch reads
answer for the refs and the HEAD read answers for the checkout, and an
unreadable HEAD counts against it -- proving a tree carries nothing cannot rest
on a probe that did not run.

Whether a tip either read finds is one anybody here vouched for is
`relabel_evidence`'s question. What is assembled here is the finding: every
reading that convicts, reported together, because an operator fixing what the
refusal names wants all of it the first time.

    Ahead-of-base is the question wherever the discussion stage recorded no
    anchor, because for those parks a branch ahead of base is exactly the
    violation.

    Where an anchor exists it is asked FIRST and on its own terms, because
    ahead-of-base cannot stand in for it in either direction. A branch reset
    all the way to base is no longer ahead of base, yet on a PR-backed issue
    that reset threw away the commits the round was certified against -- so
    the cheap answer would clear a `discussion_commits` park whose violation
    nobody resolved. The recorded ref is therefore compared to what
    `relabel_evidence` vouches for whatever its relation to base is.

    A recorded ref that no longer exists is not a mismatch: there is nothing
    local left to attribute, and a PR-backed checkout is rebuilt from the PR
    head, which never carried this stage's work. That is the same reading
    `_branch_tip_sha` gives its other caller. Commits on any OTHER candidate
    branch still convict, so a round that committed on the sibling ref of a
    legacy-pinned branch is not let through by its anchor.

    push, so by the time a tick dies past it the branch may be on the remote
    with a pull request open against it -- and nothing here can say whether it
    is. A checkout that is gone reads as clean, a local ref that never existed
    reads as nothing to attribute, and a branch an operator reset reads as
    certified: on a fresh clone all three are true at once, and the guard would
    hand the whole thing over having proved nothing.

    What follows such a handover is the sharpest version of what this guard
    exists to stop. The developer builds from base, the publication that opens
    the PR is gone, and the push takes a lease read live off the remote -- so it
    force-pushes over the published plan, adopts the pull request already open
    on that branch, and rewrites its body to close the issue on merge.

    The way out is not a reset: it is the label that owns the unfinished half.
    The `discussion` stage's own recovery restores the checkout from the PR
    head, adopts the PR that is already open, and records it -- and only once
