"""Proving a checkout is still the thing that was measured, and refusing it.

What a push sends is a COMMIT; what the handoff passes on is the CHECKOUT, and
every stage past it works from that checkout without reading it again. The
reviewer treats a head ahead of the pushed branch as unpushed work to publish,
the squash rewrites what is on the tree, and the docs pass commits over it --
so a worktree that stopped being what the size gate measured reaches a merge
through a force-push no measurement ever saw.

Each proof has two halves, because the head answers only half of what "this
checkout" is. The commit is one: a head sitting anywhere but the commit the
publication is about is refused. The tree is the other, and it is why a
reading taken once at the top of the disposition is not enough -- work can
appear beside a commit without moving it, so every proof about the commit
passes while the checkout stops being the thing that was measured.

Both halves are asked twice, on either side of a push, because the window is
the requests in between and the worktree is writable while they run. Before
the push a refusal costs nothing: nothing is on the remote, no pull request is
open, and the commit is where the developer left it. After it the publication
STANDS and only the handoff stops, so the branch and its pull request stay
right while review never reads the descendant.

Every refusal here parks under the one reason a moved checkout earns, and
every one of them is settled by the worktree rather than by words -- put back
on the named commit, or cleaned, and the next tick finishes what stopped with
nothing re-run and no agent spawned.

WHEN each of these is asked is the publication owner's, along with what the
commit they are asked about is recorded as. This owner decides only what a
proof looks at and what its refusal says.
