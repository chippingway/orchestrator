"""The one refusal in this stage a human cannot answer with words.

What `checkout_guards` holds an issue for is a checkout it could not hand to
review -- one that had left the commit the size gate approved, or one carrying
work beside it that no push would publish -- and neither of those is a
question anybody can reply to. What settles them is the checkout being that
commit and nothing else again, which is an operator's own `git checkout`
between two ticks rather than a sentence on the thread.

So the park writes the approved commit down and this owner is the proof taken
against what it wrote. It is asked on every ordinary tick rather than on a
command, because the recovery is the checkout coming back and nothing else has
to happen for it -- and it is asked about the same two things the refusal was
taken on, since a proof narrower than the refusal it answers would republish
straight back into it.

The park an adjudicated candidate waits on an operator behind asks the same
question one field over, and asks it for the same reason: what the seam past
it would measure is whatever the checkout is standing on, so a head that has
moved is a candidate nobody authorized, published on its own count under a
command that named a different commit. Which commit that park is about is read
off the record rather than off an approval, since a publication that failed
retires the generation and leaves the terms a human agreed to behind.

What the answer LICENSES is the caller's: the republication of an approved
commit, the records it spends, and the relabel behind them all belong to the
disposition that reads this. This owner decides only whether the checkout is
the one that was decided about.

    The one question the seam past that park cannot ask for it. It measures
    what the checkout is standing on, and a head that has moved off the parked
    commit is a fresh candidate: the exemption does not cover it, the override
    does not name it, so the policy's door is closed and the ordinary road
    measures it and publishes it on its own count. The push then carries a
    commit nobody authorized, under a command that named a different one.

    Which commit the park is about is read off the record rather than
    remembered, since the tick that took the park is long gone. A recorded
    override names it outright and is preferred for that reason -- it is the
    terms a human agreed to, written from the reading that measured them --
    and the exemption behind it answers a park no authorization has reached
    yet. Both are read fail-closed, so a field a hand edit truncated names no
    commit rather than a different one.

    A record naming NO commit is held too, and that is the safe direction
    rather than an omission: a park whose subject nothing can name is one
    nothing here may publish under, and the ordinary road below would publish
    whatever the checkout had become.
