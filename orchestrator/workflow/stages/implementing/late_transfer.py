"""Whether a rewrite may carry an adjudicated change onto the commit replacing it.

The gate recognizes a decided candidate by one commit and only it, which is
what keeps work committed on top of an accepted one from riding through on
somebody else's verdict. A workflow REWRITE is the one thing that turns that
rule against itself. The squash a reviewer's approval earns collapses the
accepted commit into a new object, and the clean base rebase the per-tick
refresh publishes replays it onto a base that moved; either way what comes out
carries the identical contribution and the exemption -- which names the old
object -- stops answering for it. Measured afresh, the very change a human
ruled on goes past the same ceiling and into a second adjudication, with a
pull request already open over the work.

So the exemption may MOVE, and this owner is the whole of what it may move on.
A permit is granted only when every one of these holds, and the answer is a
refusal the moment one does not:

* the commit the rewrite came from is the exact commit this issue exempts, and
  the semantic record beside it is whole -- the frozen pair the adjudication
  was taken between, the digest of what lay between them, and the scheme it
  was taken under;
* the evidence names a rewrite kind this build authorizes, and names every end
  of both contributions, the pull request, the stage, and the lease at the
  shape each of those takes;
* that publication is the one this call was entered on and the one this issue
  still records -- same pull request, same stage, and a remote standing on a
  head this permit accounts for: the lease it was granted against, or, while
  the permission is still outstanding, the rewritten commit itself, which is
  this permit's own push having landed and only its receipt being lost;
* the checkout is provably clean and standing exactly on the rewritten
  commit, and the head the push is leased against peels to a commit this host
  really holds -- it is allowed to differ from the accepted one, so nothing
  else here would ever read that object;
* the issue itself is confirmed by a read taken now, not by the snapshot the
  tick opened with, and confirmed UNCHANGED rather than merely open: no
  `paused` or `backlog` control label, and still on the workflow stage the
  rewrite recorded;
* no authorization this build cannot read is already standing for the commit
  the issue exempts, since a grant replaces that record rather than adding to
  it;
* and both contributions fingerprint, from objects this host can really hand
  back, to the same digest. The accepted one is taken over the pair the RECORD
  names rather than the pair the caller claims -- so a hand-edited base is the
  record failing to prove itself rather than a field nothing ever read -- and
  the caller's claim about what it replaced is held to that same digest, as is
  the digest any permission already standing here recorded: carried forward
  unchecked, a grant would write this reading's answer over it and call
  evidence nobody checked repaired.

Every one is asked here rather than inherited from the reading that happened
to establish it, because what a permit licenses is a push that skips the
measurement entirely. The two exceptions are the ones this call has already
taken for itself, this tick and before any effect: the entry froze the pull
request from a fresh read that refuses anything but an open one standing on
the caller's lease, and the gate proved the candidate is the commit its caller
named.

A refusal is not a park and not a failure. It leaves the exemption exactly
where it is and lets the ordinary cumulative size gate measure the rewritten
commit like any other candidate for a pull request the remote already carries
-- which is the behavior every install had before an exemption could move at
all. That measurement may well PUBLISH the same commit, since a rewrite under
the ceiling is the ordinary case, so the answer this owner gives is carried
down the push tail beside the commit it was given for: a publication the
settlement behind it rotates is one this owner vouched for on this tick, and
a permission left readable on the comment vouches for nothing.

A grant is durable BEFORE the push, and what it makes durable is the
PERMISSION rather than the move. The exemption stays exactly on the commit a
human ruled on: the rewritten object is on no remote yet, so a verdict rotated
onto it here would sit on something only this host has the moment a push fails
or a process dies. The rotation belongs to the write that receipts the landed
push, where the exemption, the identity it carries, and the account of what the
remote holds go down together or not at all -- `late_rotation` inside the push
tail is the owner of that write. What licenses
THIS tick's publication is the permit handed back to the gate, so nothing has
to move early for the push to be allowed.

That one write carries the debt as well, because the account of what the branch
carries and the account of where it has still to go may not be split: a rewrite
has already replaced the branch's commits with one by the time it runs, so a
crash between them comes back to a one-commit branch nothing says a push is
owed for -- and the next squash finds a single commit, takes the
nothing-to-squash road, and reports success without measuring or pushing
anything.

A write GitHub REFUSES is a permission that was never granted, and it is
handled here rather than allowed out: the staged payload is put back exactly as
it was found and the permit is refused, so the rewritten commit falls through
to the ordinary gate and the caller still gets an answer it can roll its rewrite
back for. Left to escape, the exception would carry past every failure path the
squash has, stranding a collapsed branch nothing recorded and nothing pushed.

The other side is the rollback: a force-push the remote refuses puts the branch
back on the head the rewrite found it on -- the accepted end where a squash
collapsed that commit, the lease where a rebase read the anchor for itself --
so what the reset owes is dropping the permission it will never spend, and
nothing else. The exemption needs nothing either way, since the grant never
moved it.

An OUTSTANDING permission is a claim on the tick after a crash as well, and it
is read two ways there. It says a push is owed for the commit it names, so the
approval standing beside it may not be spent on the object id alone -- the gate
defers, and the permit is re-asked in full over both pairs, the publication and
the lease the record itself carries. And it says the receipt behind that push
has not landed, which is why a remote already standing on the rewritten commit
is this permit's own work rather than somebody else's move. A permission this
build cannot read, or one whose commit disagrees with the debt beside it, is
neither: the ordinary cumulative gate measures the rewrite like any other
candidate, and the publication that follows spends no permit it did not earn.

    The gate skips the measurement for a commit an approval is owed a push
    for, because the approval is its own earlier decision brought back by a
    crash. That holds for every approval but one: a commit an approval names
    only because a TRANSFER let it past has never been measured and never been
    adjudicated -- what licensed it was a permit, and a permit is granted on
    terms that can stop being true between the grant and the recovery. A
    pull request repointed, an issue relabelled, a record hand-edited, or a
    contribution that no longer fingerprints alike each leave an approval
    standing over a rewrite nothing may publish unmeasured.

    So the bypass defers to the permit, which is re-asked in full over the
    record the grant left -- and where it refuses, the ordinary cumulative
    gate measures the rewrite like any other candidate.

    Asked of the PERMISSION rather than of the commit the record names, and
    that is what cross-binds it to the debt. An outstanding permission says a
    push is owed for the commit it produced, and the grant writes that
    permission and that debt in one write for one commit -- so an approval
    standing beside an outstanding permission is either the one it licensed or
    evidence that the two disagree, and neither may be spent on an object id.
    Compared against the commit the record names instead, a hand-edited target
    would make the permit invisible: the approval would look like any other
    and the rewrite nothing could revalidate would be pushed unmeasured.

    Only a record this build can vouch for ENTIRELY is recognized as spent,
    which is the record owner's own rule: a group announcing `published` over
    fields nothing else here understands, or bound to a commit this issue does
    not exempt, has not been shown to be over. A spent one licenses nothing
    outstanding, and that is what keeps the ordinary bypass intact -- a
    transfer that settled leaves its record behind for good, and reading that
    as a standing claim would send every later approval this issue earns back
    through a measurement.

    What ends the deferral is the receipt of the push the permission was
    granted for: that write carries the exemption over and moves the phase, so
    the record standing afterwards is spent and every later approval this
    issue earns is the ordinary one again. Until it lands the deferral holds,
    which costs a reading rather than a decision -- and where the permit
    refuses on the re-ask, the ordinary cumulative gate measures the rewrite

    An id the remote reports and this host cannot peel is a fetch that brought

    The PERMISSION rather than the move. The exemption stays exactly on the
    commit a human ruled on and the identity beside it stays with it, because
    the commit this permission is about is on no remote yet: rotated here, a
    push that never lands would leave a verdict on an object only this host
    has, and every later tick would read the accepted work at HEAD as carrying
    none. The rotation belongs to the write that receipts the landed push,
    where it goes down with the account of what the remote carries or not at
    all -- so what this records is a permission that stands until that write
    spends it.

    What licenses THIS tick's publication is the permit itself, handed back to
    the gate -- so nothing has to be rotated early for the push to be allowed.

    Two things go down together. The authorization is what says the move was
    earned rather than assumed: it names both pairs, the rewrite that produced
    the second, and the publication it was made against, which is what lets
    the receipt spend exactly this permission and a rollback drop exactly it.

    And the DEBT is the second, because the account of what the branch carries
    and the account of where it has still to go may not be split across two
    writes. A rewrite has already replaced the branch's commits with one by
    the time this runs, so a process dying between a record that explains that
    commit and a debt naming the push it is owed comes back to a one-commit
    branch, a remote still on the head it replaced, and nothing saying a push
    is outstanding -- and the next squash finds a single commit, takes the
    nothing-to-squash road, and reports success without measuring or pushing
    anything, so reviewer-approved work reaches the merge button neither
    counted nor on the remote. Carried on this write instead, the
    reconciliation ahead of the next handler finds the debt, republishes the
    commit under the lease the rewrite froze, and settles the transfer with
    it. The verdict that follows this call finds the debt already down for the
    same commit and leaves it exactly as it is.

    Ahead of the push rather than behind it, for the reason every other record
    this gate writes goes down before the effect it is about: a process dying
    in between comes back to an issue that says a push is owed for the commit
    on its branch and what that push is allowed to carry over.
