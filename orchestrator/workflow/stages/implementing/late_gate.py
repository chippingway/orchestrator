"""The size question a committed candidate answers before it is published.

The seam the whole late gate hangs off. Every clean committed developer
outcome -- a run that finished, one the timeout killed after it had committed,
and one recovered from a branch a crash stranded -- reaches publication
through one place, so measuring here is what makes the three of them one
contract: whatever is about to be pushed is measured first, and an oversized
candidate is held rather than published.

Held, not discarded. Nothing is pushed, no pull request is opened, and the
commit stays exactly where the developer left it; what changes is the label,
which hands the issue to the late coordinator under `workflow:decomposing`.
That coordinator owns everything past this point -- the hold, the
adjudication, and what a `single` or a `split` verdict earns -- and it
reconciles the very record this gate froze.

The order of the steps is the failure contract. The candidate is proved to be
a commit this host holds, the base is frozen from what the REMOTE says the
branch is at, and both are persisted with the `measuring` boundary BEFORE a
single line is counted: a tick that dies over the count comes back to the pair
this one froze rather than to a candidate re-derived from a branch that has
moved since. A reading that could not be taken is never a small candidate --
it is a typed failure on both sinks, and the retry a trusted bare
`/orchestrator continue` drives re-measures that recorded pair without
re-running the developer who already finished. Most of those failures park at
once. The two that name the TRANSPORT rather than the work -- a base the
remote would not answer for, and one a fetch did not bring back -- clear
themselves often enough to be worth a bounded number of quiet tries first: the
miss goes on the record and nothing else happens, no human is told, and only
the pair that has lost the last of them is parked. The failure is reported
even where no pair was ever frozen: the identity is minted for the record
rather than the refusal going unsaid, and deliberately not persisted, since a
pinned cycle with no candidate under it reconciles nothing and would read as a
live cycle to the guard that ends one when the issue is closed.

What a candidate an approval let through still owes is a PUSH, and the commit
it owes it for is recorded before the write that drops the generation naming
it. The checkout is proved to be ON that commit before any later tick spawns
or republishes -- the object alone outlives the branch -- so a checkout the
work never reached parks for the worktree rather than publishing what it
carries or paying for a second developer over it.

What the record already NAMES is what a later tick reconciles, and the current
head is never a substitute for it. A recorded candidate is proved before
anything else -- a host that cannot peel that object is one the work was not
made on, and it parks rather than measuring or publishing whatever the branch
points at there -- and a recorded base is retried by asking for that exact
object rather than by reading the remote again, which would answer with
wherever the branch has moved to and measure a different pair under the same
generation. Only once both commits are proved present does a head that differs
mean what it usually means -- and only on a disposition with a run behind it:
a developer resumed on a human's guidance who committed again, which is a
fresh candidate. A reconciliation has no such run, so a head that moved
between the proof its caller took and the one taken here is a checkout
something moved mid-tick, and it is refused rather than measured or pushed.

Four candidates skip the measurement, and none is a bypass. Three of them are
commits this workflow has already DECIDED about, and they are recognized the
same way, by naming one commit and only it -- work committed on top of any of
them is measured as the fresh candidate it is. One is the exact commit an
adjudication accepted, which the exemption names. One is the commit an
approval still owes a push: a crash between the write that approves a
candidate and the push it licenses brings the same commit back here with its
generation already retired, and re-deciding it there would re-measure a
settled question against a base that has moved since -- routing work a human
may already have adjudicated back into adjudication. One is the commit this
stage already PUSHED, which is that window one step further on: past the push
a pull request carries the work and only the relabel is owed, so a reading
that came back oversized there would hold nothing back and route a published
branch to adjudication. The fourth is a NEW candidate while `DECOMPOSE` is
off -- the switch decides whether new work enters the gate and decides nothing
about work already in it, about a reconciliation answering a reading the gate
itself recorded, or about a commit it has already approved or published. In it
means a generation naming THIS commit: one naming another is a record a
resumed developer's fresh commit has moved past, so the fresh commit is the
new work the switch publishes untouched and the superseded record is retired
rather than left over a commit nothing will push.

This owner is the order those questions are asked in and nothing else. What a
tick is ABOUT is `late_records`, the pair it measures over is `late_freeze`,
the reading itself is `late_reading`, what a recovery proves first is
`late_evidence`, what an answer earns is `late_verdict`, and what a refusal
costs is `late_parks`.

    Three records say a commit was already DECIDED about, and they say it the
    same way: by naming one commit and only it, so anything committed on top
    of any of them is work nobody decided about and is measured as the fresh
    candidate it is.

    The exemption is a verdict a human's adjudication reached, and it outlives
    the publication because the gate would otherwise measure the same
    candidate past the same ceiling forever. The approval is this gate's own,
    and it lives only until the push it licenses lands: the write that
    approves a candidate drops the generation naming it, so a crash before the
    push brings the same commit back here with nothing left to say it was
    already settled. Measuring it again is not a second opinion -- the base
    has moved since, so it is a different question -- and answering it can
    route work a human already adjudicated straight back into adjudication.

    The publication record is that same window read from its far end, and the
    one that matters most because the effects are already out, and it is the
    one asked against the REMOTE rather than off the record alone: a receipt
    naming a commit the pull request has since moved off records a
    publication that is over, and work the remote no longer carries is work
    this gate has not decided about. past the push
    the branch is on the remote and a pull request carries it, while the label
    still says implementing until the relabel lands. A relabel that failed
    leaves the next tick reading a published branch as work nobody has ruled
    on, and an oversized answer there would route it to adjudication with
    nothing left to hold back -- the one outcome this gate exists to prevent.
    So the commit is recognized rather than re-read, the pull request that
    already carries it is reused, and the relabel is finished.

    The switch is the last answer and is asked last, here rather than at the
    door, for the one state the door could not settle. An approval keeps
    the switch from bypassing, because a commit this gate decided has to be
    published under the id it decided about -- and that is a claim about ONE
    commit, which nothing can check until the head is proved. Past that proof
    and not it, the approval describes work this branch has moved past: the
    candidate in hand is new work, and new work is exactly what the switch
    keeps out of the gate. A record already in the gate, and a call answering
    a reading the gate itself took, are neither -- and the second is asked as
    `answering` rather than as the wider "no developer ran", which a rebase, a
    resolution, and a recovery push each set over work this gate has never
    seen.

    "A record already in the gate" is a record about THIS commit, which is the
    same claim by one commit and only it the three above are recognized by. A
    generation naming some OTHER candidate is one a resumed developer's fresh
    commit has moved past, and the fresh commit is new work: measured where
    the switch is on, published untouched where it is off, and in both cases
    the superseded record is retired rather than left over a commit nothing
    will publish. Read as "in the gate" instead, an install with the switch
    off measures exactly the work it turned the gate off for.
