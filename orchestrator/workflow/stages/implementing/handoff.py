"""Handing a published implementation on: one write, then the label.

Reached only where the push landed, the pull request carries it, and the
checkout was proved twice over to still be the thing that was measured -- so
nothing here refuses and nothing here parks. What is left is a record to spend
and a claim to give up, in that order.

The record names `pr_number` AND `branch` together, because a state that
arrived without a branch (an awaiting-human resume that opened the pull request
without passing the fresh-spawn persist site) would leave the next tick's
branch resolution falling back to the legacy name while the live pull request
sits on the slug-namespaced one.

Resetting the counters belongs to that same write rather than sitting beside
it: the issue moved forward, so the review round, the retry budget, the
silent-park streak, and the timeout watermark are all spent, and any of them
left behind would mis-fire a later hop back into implementing.

WHEN this is reached is the publication owner's, which is once both proofs
taken around the push have passed. This owner decides only what the last write
says and what goes out after it.

    """Record the published PR/branch, reset the per-PR budgets, and hand off
    to `validating`.

    The docs pass runs only as the final-docs handoff after the reviewer agent
    approves, so a fresh commit goes straight to validating.

    What this staged goes out DURABLY before the label does, and that ordering
    is the whole of why the write is here rather than left to the caller. The
    label is the last thing on this road that another stage reads, and past it
    the issue is no longer implementing's: nothing here runs on it again. So
    every record this line spends -- the plan SHA, the certified baseline, the
    handoff anchor, and above all the commit an approval said was still owed a
    push -- has to be spent before the label, or a tick that died in between
    strands it on an issue that has moved on. A stranded approval is the
    sharpest: nothing under `validating` spends it, implementing never sees
    the issue again, and the record goes on freezing the branch out of the
    ordinary base refresh for the rest of the issue's life.

    The cost is one pinned write per publication, and the window it leaves is
    the one the commit this line records exists for. A relabel that failed --
    or a process that died between the two -- leaves an implementing issue
    whose branch is pushed and whose pull request is open, and whose every
    gate record is already spent. Read as work nobody has ruled on, that
    branch is measured again on the next tick, against a base that has moved
    or a ceiling that was retuned since, and an oversized answer would route
    it to adjudication with the push and the pull request already made. So the
    pushed commit goes down in this same write: the next tick recognizes it,
    publishes it without a reading, reuses the pull request that already
    carries it, and finishes the relabel this one could not.
