"""What a recovery proves about a recorded pair before it acts on one.

The refusals the paths with no developer behind them are held to. A tick
answering a reading a previous one recorded cannot take the checkout on trust:
the worktree has to be there, both recorded commits readable in it, and the
head actually ON the candidate -- because nothing here produced the work, so
anything else in the checkout is not this issue's answer to substitute in.

The head is what every one of these proves, never the object on its own. An
object store outlives the branch that put a commit in it: a worktree rebuilt
from the base or reset onto it, on the very host that made the commit, still
holds the object while standing somewhere else entirely. So "is it here" is a
question that answers yes about a checkout carrying none of the work -- which
reads downstream as a branch with nothing to publish, and buys a second
developer run for an implementation that is already written.

    What it may not do is re-run the developer. The recorded commit is the

    the worktree -- so the park says so and is retried by the next continue.

    What a trusted bare continue buys is a re-reading of the EXACT pair that

    else is not work this workflow produced. Measuring it would answer the
    size question about a commit nobody froze, and publishing it -- which is
    what the switch being off would do -- would push a branch no reading
    covers.

    A park that named NO commit is refused for the same reason and more
    flatly: there is no pair to re-read, so what a retry would take is a
    FIRST reading, of whatever the checkout points at by then. Nothing ties
    that head to this issue -- a rebase, a reset, a rebuilt worktree all leave
    one -- so a base with no work on it, or somebody else's, would be measured
    and published as this implementation. The way on from there is the
    developer, which is what guidance buys; a bare continue is answered by
    saying no reading exists to take again.

    The comparison is by NAME rather than by proof, because "is the checkout
    still on it" and "can this host read it" are two questions and only the
