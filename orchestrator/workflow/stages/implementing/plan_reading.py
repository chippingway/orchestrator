"""What the recorded plan PR carries, and where that leaves the branch.

Two readings, and both halves of a read-only relabel rest on them: the guard
that screens an operator's move to `implementing` takes them once before it
rules on anything, and the reconcile that keeps an accepted handoff in step
with its pull request takes them again on every tick until a developer
publishes. Neither may decide on a remembered answer. Between the publication
and the relabel the humans have had that design on a pull request -- they can
correct the Markdown on it, or merge the base into its branch to make it
mergeable -- and a head they moved is the one thing no record here can report.

The second reading has to move the ref before it can answer. Where the
developer starts is where the branch REALLY ends up, never where the anchoring
meant to put it, so the checkout is brought forward first and what comes back
is what gets recorded. A move that established nothing is not a tip at all: the
caller holds rather than spawning a developer on a design its reviewers
replaced, whose ordinary push would read their head off the remote as its own
lease and overwrite it.

A read that fails is the same answer both times -- nothing was established --
and it ends the tick where it happened, writing nothing, since every decision
behind it is durable and the next tick asks again from the same state.

    The round anchor is the answer on every issue without a plan PR, and on one
    whose PR is still on the commit this stage published: it is the tip the
    guard certified, and the spawn path reads it back to keep the commits an
    issue arrived with from passing as a dev run to finish.

    A plan PR the humans moved is the other case, and the branch is brought
    forward onto that head before anything is written or spawned. The developer
    has to build on the design its reviewers actually approved, and a push from
    a tip that does not contain their amendment is what would overwrite it.

    A plan PR that MERGED is the third case, and the anchor is wrong for it
    even when it matches: the design landed, so the base carries it along with
    everything else that has landed since, and the branch it was open against
    may be deleted. Left on the commit that merged, the developer starts behind
    the branch they are building for and their PR opens against a base they
    never saw. So the move is asked for with no head at all, which is how the
    anchor is told to put the checkout on the base.

    What comes back is where the branch REALLY ends up, never where the move
    intended to put it: the reviewed head, or the base. A move that established
    neither leaves the handoff pending rather than recording the
    anchor -- the checkout would still be behind the reviewers, and a baseline
    naming any other commit would have the spawn path read the difference as an
