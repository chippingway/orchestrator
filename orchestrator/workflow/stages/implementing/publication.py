"""Turning a committed worktree into a pushed branch, a PR, and a handoff.

The order here is what makes the step re-runnable. The push comes first and a
failed push parks instead of continuing, because the commits stay in the
worktree and would otherwise keep `_has_new_commits` true and re-comment on
every poll. The PR is then reused if one is already open on the branch, so a
tick that died between `open_pr` and the relabel recovers instead of 422-ing on
a duplicate. Only then is the handoff written.

None of it happens without ONE named commit, which is what the first line
here establishes: a push named against nothing sends whatever the branch has
become by the time git runs it, records no receipt, and leaves both proofs
around it with nothing to compare against -- so a checkout that cannot say
what it is on publishes nothing rather than publishing unnamed.

What that checkout IS gets proved twice around all of it, because the worktree
stays writable while the push and the two pull-request requests run. What each
proof looks at -- the commit AND the tree, since work can appear beside a
commit without moving it -- and what a refusal says and parks under belongs to
`checkout_guards`. This owner decides only WHERE the two are taken: before
the push, where nothing is published and the tick simply stops, and once the
pull request is open, where the publication stands and only the handoff stops.
Everything past that handoff reads the checkout and none of it measures again.

What the pull request itself says -- its title, its body, and the dev session
the body attributes the branch to -- is `dev_pr`'s, along with the reuse that
reads that attribution back off a pull request somebody else opened. This owner
decides only WHEN one is opened, which is once the push has landed.

What the handoff itself writes -- the pull request and the branch it records,
the records it spends, the counters it resets, and the relabel it goes out
ahead of -- is `handoff`'s, for the same division: this owner decides only WHEN
it is reached, which is once both proofs taken around the push have passed.

    Three answers, and the one that matters is the one a bare `None` gets
    wrong. `None` lets the transport take its OWN reading of the remote and
    lease against whatever it finds, which is right for the ordinary initial
    publication -- there is no pull request yet, and the lease is there only
    so a self-restart's re-push is not refused as a non-fast-forward.

    It is wrong for a publication the gate admitted BECAUSE the pull request
    is already standing on the commit. That answer is a reading, and between
    it and this push the branch is somebody else's to move: leased against a
    fresh reading, a tip that moved in the window is adopted as the lease and
    the candidate is force-pushed over it. Leased against the commit the proof
    was about, the same push sends nothing where the branch has not moved and
    is refused outright where it has.

    The third is an approval taken on the PUBLISHED side, which a settled
    adjudication sends back here: the reading it was measured under is only
    worth what the head it was taken over still is, so the push is pinned to
    that head and a pull request somebody moved during the adjudication
    rejects it instead of being force-overwritten.

    Everything past this line is named against what it returns: the push, the
    record the handoff leaves, and the proof taken once the pull request is
    open. Deciding it once and up front is what keeps those three about the
    same commit -- a checkout re-read at any of them is a checkout that may
    have moved since.

    The gate names it wherever it proved one. Where it did not -- a candidate
    the switch kept out of the gate -- the checkout names it, because the
    alternative is a push that names nothing and therefore publishes whatever
    the branch has become by the time git runs it, with nothing on the issue
    afterwards saying which commit that was. The switch keeps candidates out
    of the MEASUREMENT; it does not make them unnameable, and it is an
    operator's to turn back on between one tick and the next.

    Then it is made durable, and only where the record does not already say
    it. Between this line and the handoff the branch goes to the remote and a
    pull request opens over it, and a tick that died in there would leave an
    issue whose branch is published and whose record says nothing was owed --
    which the next tick reads as work nobody has ruled on. The roads that
    were approved or adjudicated already wrote this commit down and pay
    nothing here; the ones that were not pay one write.

    None is the answer that stops the publication, and both roads reach it.
    The checkout is not on the commit the gate approved, so nothing may be
    pushed from it -- or the checkout cannot say what it is on at all, which
    is a repository to look at rather than a commit to name. Neither publishes
    anything.

    That second one is a refusal rather than a fallback because of what a
    nameless push COSTS. Named against nothing, git sends whatever the branch
    has become by the time it runs, and nothing goes on the issue saying which
    commit that was -- so the receipt the handoff leaves is empty, the proof
    taken once the pull request is open has no commit to hold the checkout to,
    and the one taken before the push has none either. Every guarantee this
    owner exists to make is about one named commit, and a publication with no
    name is outside all of them at once.

    One commit is decided on before any of this runs, and the push, the
    record the handoff leaves, and the proof taken once the pull request is
    open are all about that one. The commit on `approved` is it wherever the
    size gate proved one; where the gate proved none -- a candidate the switch
    kept out of it -- the checkout names it instead. A checkout that cannot
    name one publishes nothing at all, because a push that names nothing sends
    whatever the branch has become by the time git runs it and leaves every
    proof past this line with no commit to hold it to.
    `_publication_intent` is where that is settled and made durable.

    Naming the commit is only half of it, because what the handoff passes on
    is the CHECKOUT. Every stage past this one reads that checkout: the
    reviewer treats a head ahead of the pushed branch as unpushed work to
    publish, the squash rewrites what is on it, and the docs pass commits on
    top. So a worktree sitting on a descendant would hand review an
    implementation the size gate never saw, one publication later and with no
    measurement between. That is asked twice, because the window is the three
    requests in between: before the push nothing is published and the commit
    stays where it is, and after the pull request is open the publication
    stands while the HANDOFF stops, so review never reads the descendant.

    Both boundaries ask it of the TREE as well as of the head, because the
    head answers only half of what "this checkout" is. Uncommitted work can
    appear while `HEAD` never moves, so every proof about the commit passes
    over it -- and the stage this hands to takes no reading of its own, so a
    tree carrying work the pull request does not show reaches the squash and
    the docs pass, which commit it or destroy it. Cleanliness proved at the
    top of the disposition is a fact about a moment that has passed by the
    time either effect runs.

    Work that ENDED is refused immediately before the push, on the same terms
    every gated publication onto an open pull request refuses one. A close a
    poll observed is one half: the gate's own barrier ends the CYCLE, which
    answers every candidate a record is still live for -- and the roads this
    seam reaches it by are exactly the ones where none is, since an approval
    whose push failed retires its generation before that push. The pull
    request this push would JOIN is the other, whichever of the two the tick
    has -- one the gate proved, or one the record names and the reuse below
    would find by branch. Either ending in the window between the tick's first
    reading and here leaves that lookup answering nothing, so a second pull
    request is opened over the work and `pr_number` overwritten with it. What
    work nobody wants may never earn is this effect, so the refusal is held:
    nothing pushed, no pull request opened, no handoff, and the receipt and
    debt left exactly as they stand for the cleanup or the retry they are
    owed. `push_barrier` owns both readings and the one ending that is not an
    ending for this push.
