"""Why a conversation stage's park is checked before an implementing relabel is trusted.

The `question` and `discussion` stages both park with `awaiting_human=True` and
a stage-prefixed reason so their own next tick can pick the conversation back
up. Implementing's resume path cannot read those flags -- they mean nothing to
it -- so a relabel out of either stage has to clear them or refuse, and the two
are handled here together because the hazard is the same: what either agent may
write is narrow and neither stage ships it as dev work. The question agent may
write nothing at all. The discussion agent may commit one file, the plan its
humans confirmed, and only its own stage publishes that -- through a check of
what the branch carries, and onto a PR of the plan alone. Anything else either
of them leaves behind is for an operator to look at, never for this stage to
push.

Which of the two happens is decided by the worktree and the branch, never by
the park reason alone: `relabel_hazard` takes those readings against what
`relabel_evidence` can vouch for, and `relabel_refusal` owns what a
finding costs an operator to clear.

A clean pair means the relabel IS the unblock signal: the flags are dropped and
`last_action_comment_id` is ratcheted past what that agent posted, or the later
validating -> in_review seed would replay it as fresh PR feedback. The round
anchor is retired here rather than discarded -- it becomes
`read_only_baseline_sha`, the floor the dev run that follows is measured
against, since the branch it inherits is already ahead of base.

A published plan asks one more question before any of that, and `plan_reading`
answers it, because between the publication and the relabel the humans have had
that design on a PR: they can correct the Markdown on it, or merge the base
into its branch to make it mergeable, and either leaves the PR on a head this
orchestrator never wrote. So the PR is read before anything is ruled on, and
what it carries now is used twice. The checkout is brought forward onto it -- a
developer handed the commit we published would build on a design its reviewers
have moved past, and push a tip that does not contain the head they approved.
And that head replaces `discussion_plan_sha` in the very write that retires
`discussion_plan_path`, because the path record is what answered the merged-PR
question until now: a later tick with the path gone and the old commit still
recorded would read the humans' own edit as this stage's work and close the
issue as `done` with no developer having run. The baseline then names where the
branch really ended up, which is the anchor again whenever that head could not
be fetched at all.

Reading GitHub before the guard rules is also what makes the move crash-safe.
The branch is anchored ahead of the write that records it, so a tick that dies
in between leaves a tip past the anchor -- and the next one, holding the same
reviewed head, recognizes that tip as certified rather than convicting the
branch of it. A read that fails ends the tick where it happened, writing
nothing, since every decision behind it is durable.

    agent wrote.

    `_handle_question` and `_handle_discussion` park with `awaiting_human=True`
    and `park_reason="<stage>_*"` so their own next tick can pick the
    conversation back up; those flags are opaque to implementing's resume path
    and would mis-fire it. When no such park is present this is a no-op
    returning False.

    The clear must check the actual worktree, NOT just the park reason. Both
    agents write nothing a human has not asked for, but a misbehaving run can
    park as `question_commits` / `discussion_plan_invalid` / `*_dirty` (or a
    `*_timeout` that committed before being killed) with unreviewed code state
    on the per-issue branch. Silently dropping the park would let the fresh-spawn
    branch's recovered-worktree shortcut (`_has_new_commits` -> push) publish
    those commits as if a dev session had authored them -- work no human
    confirmed and no check of the stage that produced it ever passed.

    Returns True when the caller must return this tick: the unsafe relabel was
    re-parked as `<stage>_unsafe_relabel` and pinned state written here.

    Returns False otherwise: either no conversation-stage park is present, or the
    worktree and branch are both clean so the relabel IS the unblock signal --
    the park flags are dropped and `last_action_comment_id` ratcheted past the
    agent's last comment (so the eventual validating->in_review watermark seed
    cannot replay it as fresh PR feedback) before the caller falls through to
    the fresh-spawn path.

    It also returns True, writing nothing at all, when the plan PR this issue
    records could not be read, or when what it carries could not be put on the
    branch. What that PR is on decides both what the developer inherits and what
    the write below records in place of the path record it retires, and guessing
    either is worse than waiting: the next tick asks again from the same durable
    state. Accepting the handoff on a checkout still sitting behind the reviewed
    head is the case that costs something -- the developer would build on a
    design its reviewers replaced, and the ordinary push that followed would
    read their head off the remote as its own lease and overwrite it.
