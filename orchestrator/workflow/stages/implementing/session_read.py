"""What the pinned state says about the dev session, and what a run's text says
about its health.

`_read_dev_session` is the read every spawn and resume starts from: it returns
the full configured agent command string as the durable role identity, so a
`DEV_AGENT` flip between ticks cannot retarget an in-flight issue at a backend
that never ran on it. The three classifiers beside it read the other direction
-- the CLI's own words -- and each answers exactly one recovery question: was
the session GC'd, did its transcript outgrow the context window, is the account
out of quota. They sit with the read because all four are about the same
session and none of them may act: each returns a verdict its caller disposes.

`_as_blockquote` is here because every one of those verdicts ends up quoted
back to a human in the comment the park posts.

    `spec` is the full configured agent command string the next run
    will use -- callers persist it verbatim BEFORE invoking `run_agent`
    so the recorded role identity survives a spawn that returns no
    session id (CLI hiccup, missing output file, etc.). Without that,
    a fresh spawn that nevertheless commits would leave `dev_agent`
    unset and a later `DEV_AGENT` flip would silently retarget the next
    resume at a backend that never ran on this issue.

    The pinned `dev_agent` field stores that spec -- e.g. `"codex"`,
    `"claude"`, or `"codex -m gpt-5.5 -c 'model_reasoning_effort=\"xhigh\"'"`
    -- as the durable role identity. Re-parsing it here means in-flight
    resumes use the same backend AND args the fresh spawn used, even
    after a `DEV_AGENT` env flip between ticks.

    Backward compatibility:
      * Legacy bare-backend values (`"codex"` / `"claude"`) re-parse to
        `(backend, ())` -- no args -- which is what those deployments
        had at the time they were spawned. `spec` is the same bare
        string; persisting it again is a no-op rewrite.
      * Legacy `codex_session_id` (written before `dev_agent` existed)
        yields `spec="codex"`. A config flip to claude cannot strand
        that session -- it stays on codex with no args.
      * When the issue has never been spawned, returns the current
        config's `(DEV_AGENT_SPEC, DEV_AGENT, DEV_AGENT_ARGS, None)`
        for the imminent fresh spawn to use AND persist.
