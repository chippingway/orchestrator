"""What one historical resume call supplied, checked before the run is built.

The dev resume entry point still accepts the positional-and-keyword call its
several callers were written against, so its arguments arrive as an
`inspect`-bound blob rather than as named parameters. These two records are
what turns that blob back into something typed. `_DevResumeRequest` freezes
exactly what one call supplied and answers which stage every record the run
emits is attributed to; `_DevResumeOptions` rejects an unknown keyword that
named parameters would have refused on their own, so a mistyped `pause_guard=`
raises the `TypeError` it deserves instead of being swallowed and quietly
resuming without a live-pause guard.

They validate rather than carry, which is why they live apart from the frozen
handoff records: nothing here has to survive a boundary the spawn cannot see
across, and both are finished before the first attempt runs.
