"""The frozen records one implementing tick hands between its owners.

Each one exists because a value has to survive a boundary the spawn cannot see
across. `_PreparedDevRun` carries `before_sha` -- the pre-agent HEAD -- from
whoever started the run to whoever disposes it, because that watermark is the
only thing that tells a commit produced by THIS run from one already on the
branch. `_AgentWork` and `_PRWork` carry the worktree (and, once pushed, the
branch) so the publication owner never re-derives either. `_DevSession` and
`_DevResumePlan` freeze the locked spec, backend, args, and session id together
with the fresh-spawn decision, so a resume cannot half-rotate a session.

    reading a previous tick recorded, so a head that has moved is not fresh

    writable in between. A commit landing in that window is a different
    candidate -- measured there, pushed there, and recorded there -- while the
    reading that licensed the recovery was about another one. Named, the gate
