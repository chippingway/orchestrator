"""Whether the work a late record still owes a push for has already ended.

The reconciliation that runs ahead of every stage ends in a PUSH -- the reading
it takes does, and the debt road beside it exists to make one -- while the
terminal that drains finished work runs inside the stage handler, which is
BEHIND it. So an ending that reaches the orchestrator between the crash and the
recovery is the way work would otherwise land on a pull request nobody can
merge: a branch force-moved onto an issue somebody closed, or onto a pull
request a human already merged or turned down.

Two facts, because an issue's own flag shows only one of them. The OBJECT the
tick opened with says whether a human closed the issue. The PULL REQUEST the
record names says the other half -- a merge leaves the issue open until a stage
terminal reads it, and a close without a merge leaves it open for good -- and
there is nowhere for this push to land in either case. The gate below refuses
to freeze an entry against a terminal pull request, so without this the road
would end in `late_measurement_failed`: a human parked over a publication that
is finished.

Read fail-OPEN, which is the direction every reading whose alternative is
stranding an issue is read in: a remote that would not answer says nothing
about whether the work is over, so the tick falls through to the road that
takes its own reading and parks with the reason it fails for. The same fact
asked immediately before a PUSH is read the other way round, by
`late_publication`, because what falling through costs there is a branch
nothing can put back.

Asked BEHIND the record questions rather than at the reconciliation's door,
and that is a cost rather than a preference: the pull-request half is a
request, and this owner is consulted ahead of every stage on every poll. Read
at the door it would cost one request per issue per tick, and the only ticks
its answer can change are the ones that have something left to reconcile --
every one of which is behind that point.

What a caller does with True is hand the tick back, which costs nothing: the
stage's own terminal is the next thing that runs, and it marks the issue `done`
or `rejected` with the record, the branch and the debt left exactly as they
stand for it to drain.
