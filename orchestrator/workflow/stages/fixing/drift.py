"""The rebase a parked fix will never get from anyone else.

The per-tick base sync deliberately stands down on every `awaiting_human`
park, so a validating-route transient park whose recovery keeps failing can sit
forever while the base moves out from under its worktree -- and the underlying
cause is often that very base advance. This owner is the one exit from that:
classify the drift, say so on the PR, and hand the branch to
`resolving_conflict`, which owns reconciling it before the next reviewer round.

Two drift shapes reconcile through the same label, and telling them apart is
the whole classification: a worktree behind base needs a rebase, while one
already rebased locally but never pushed needs a force-publish over a stale
remote head. Everything else -- a missing worktree, a dirty one an operator may
be inspecting, or a branch genuinely in sync with the PR -- reports no drift,
because there the transient condition really is the blocker and the HITL
contract says a human answers it.

The `pending_fix_*` bookmarks and in_review watermarks are left untouched on
the way out, so the eventual in_review re-entry still re-discovers the feedback
that started the loop.

      * worktree BEHIND `<remote>/<base>` -> needs a rebase.
