"""One fixing tick, in the order its questions have to be asked.

The preflight runs before anything else, and everything inside it outranks the
fix-loop rather than merely preceding it. A merged or closed PR is the answer
to every remaining question, so the terminal arcs are drained BEFORE the
rescan -- otherwise a closed issue whose PR merged sits closed and labeled
`fixing` forever. A closed issue with no resolvable PR is left alone instead of
parked, because parking a closed issue helps nobody. A `fixing` label with no
pinned `pr_number` can only have come from a manual relabel (in_review holds
the PR before it routes here), so it parks once and waits for a human to put
the label back.

A failed PR fetch ends the tick the same way, deliberately quietly: PyGithub
failures here are transient, and because no watermark has moved yet the next
tick re-fetches and picks up exactly where this one stopped.

Then the rescan, the parked dispatch, and the resume. The empty-feedback exit
between them is the one that is easy to miss: nothing unread means a prior tick
already consumed the batch (or an operator advanced the watermarks by hand), so
the issue would otherwise sit in `fixing` with no work. It clears the route
bookkeeping and bounces to `validating` for a fresh reviewer read of the
current head -- after publishing whatever an earlier run committed and never
pushed, because on the validating route this exit is the only tick left that
can. That route's feedback is a reviewer comment the orchestrator authored
itself, which the rescan filters out, so a run whose outcome was discarded (a
`paused` label applied mid-run) is never re-run: without the publish here the
reviewer would read a head that is missing the fix it asked for.

    The live-pause guard promises that work committed while `paused` was on
    reaches the PR once the label comes off, and on the validating route the
    bounce below is the only tick left to keep it: the reviewer feedback that
    started the round is orchestrator-authored, so the rescan filters it out
    and no later run rediscovers it. Probing here is what makes the bounce
    honor that promise instead of relabeling over a head the fix never reached.

    It is one of the seams a candidate reaches a published pull request
    through, so the size gate stands in front of this push exactly as it does
    in front of the shared dev-fix one -- a stranded commit is work nobody
    measured, and a bounce that pushed it would be the way past a gate every
    other route passes. A held candidate stops the bounce outright: the gate
    has moved the issue to the adjudication, and relabeling over that would
    publish the very question it just opened.

    `pushed` is True only when the branch actually moved, so the caller counts
    a reviewer round for a fix the reviewer can now see. `spends` is that same
    round handed to the gate up front, for the exit where the caller never
    gets to count it: a hold relabels, so bookkeeping applied afterwards is
    lost to any crash in that window and no later tick goes back for it.

    The worktree may be gone (a terminal cleanup, a fresh host),
    `_stranded_fix_unpushed` refuses every shape it cannot vouch for, and a
