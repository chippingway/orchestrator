"""The records one fixing tick hands between its owners.

`_FixingContext` is the tick itself, and the PR inside it is the live one the
preflight fetched once at the top: re-reading it per owner would let the
terminal check, the drift comparison against `pr.head.sha`, and the conflict
notice come from three different fetches of a PR a human may be closing.

`_FixingFeedback` keeps the three surfaces apart as well as concatenated,
because the two consumers need opposite shapes: the prompt reads `all_items` in
one order, while the watermark ratchet has to advance each surface only to the
max id consumed on that surface.

`_ParkedFixingDecision` is how a parked tick answers without the caller having
to re-derive it: `stop` says the tick is fully handled, and `replay_batch`
carries the preserved feedback an accepted `/orchestrator continue` resumes on
instead of the per-tick rescan.

`_FixingResumeRun` carries what the disposition cannot re-derive after the run:
the worktree it actually ran in (the resolve may have recreated it), whether an
operator paused mid-run, and the HEAD on both sides -- the only thing that
tells a pushed fix from a no-commit acknowledgement.
