"""The dev run, and everything a finished run leaves behind.

The quiet window comes first: a human mid-thought posts three comments in a
minute, and resuming on the first would spend the session on a fragment. Each
rescan re-reads the freshest timestamp, so a later comment extends the wait
rather than racing it -- and an accepted `/orchestrator continue` skips it
outright, because that is a deliberate operator signal rather than chatter.

The run itself refreshes `user_content_hash` on BOTH outcomes, because the dev
saw the quoted comments either way: leaving the baseline behind would let the
next handler that checks for a body edit read the comments it just consumed as
fresh drift and resume a second time on input already handled.

Two refusals sit between the finished run and any disposition, and both bail
WITHOUT writing pinned state so the whole tick is re-decidable next time. A
shutdown kill must cover the new-commit case too: falling through would consume
the feedback while the commit sits unpushed, and the next tick would see
nothing to do and bounce a PR head that is missing the fix. Leaving it on disk
is what lets a later clean run republish it through the stranded-fix tail.

Then the disposition. The ACK fast path is in_review-route only -- the
validating reviewer asked for a concrete change, so an ACK there is not an
answer -- and it stands down on a stranded commit, because the ack vouches for
the feedback and not for what the PR head actually carries. Whatever happens,
the consumed watermarks advance before the pushed / not-pushed split, and a
pushed fix drops the bookmarks, updates `review_round` per the route, and flips
straight to `validating`. Docs do not run on this exit: the single docs pass
belongs to the final-docs handoff after reviewer approval.
