"""What the humans did with the plan, read off the pull request carrying it.

Three answers come back, and the two terminal ones share the tail every other
stage's terminals use -- the timestamp, the label, the usage receipt before the
write, the event, and the close -- because a discussion that finished is
finished the same way a review that finished is. A merged plan PR is the humans
agreeing to the design, which is `done`; one closed without merging is them
declining it, which is `rejected`. Both name `discussion` as the stage, since
that is the label the issue is sitting on and what an audit row has to
attribute the run to.

An OPEN one is the third answer, and it decides nothing. It changes nothing --
no label, no write, no comment -- and, crucially, it takes nothing down: the
worktree and the branches the plan lives on are what the pull request is open
against, and reaping them while a human is still reading the plan would close
their review out from under them. That holds whether or not the ISSUE is still
open, which is why a closed issue is handed here too rather than finalized on
the close.

A pull request that could not be fetched is that same hold: nothing is decided
on a read that failed, and the tick after this one asks again. What it must
never do is fall through, since "GitHub declined once" would otherwise open a
round on a design that has already been agreed.

Both callers in `terminal` reach the same finalize, and they bring different
amounts of the question with them. One hands over a number the publication
wrote down, and everything that number turns out to be is decided here. The
other recovered a number from a publication that opened a pull request and died
before recording it, and holds on its own for an open one and for a lookup
nobody could take -- so only a DECIDED pull request ever arrives from that side.
It writes the number to pinned state before handing it over, since the tail
below reads the number, and the branch it reaps, off that record.
