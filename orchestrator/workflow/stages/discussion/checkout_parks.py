"""The endings that report on the per-issue checkout rather than on a plan.

What every park here has in common is that the tree is the subject: it holds
work nothing may run over, or it would not answer at all. None of them touches
the round anchor, because a commit is precisely when that number has to
survive -- it is the only recorded point that separates what an agent wrote
from what the branch already carried, so it is both the reset target these
parks quote and what the implementing relabel guard measures the branch
against once the operator has reset.

The two dirty parks are distinct on purpose even though both quote the same
bounded path list. One is the agent leaving work loose where the only thing it
may write is a committed plan; the other is a checkout that arrived already
holding work, which no agent of this tick touched -- and the operator's next
move differs, so the reason has to say which happened rather than leaving them
to guess from the tree. A checkout `git status` could not report on at all is a
third answer to the same question and carries its own reason for the same
reason: an empty path list is what a clean tree gives, so an operator reading
the dirty one would go looking for changes that were never named.

    A park this stage wrote earlier said "reset the worktree"; this one is for

    dirtied or committed to afterwards. Without it a human who answers the
    frontier gets silence, since the guard that refuses to open a round on such
    a tree has nothing on the thread to point them at.

    The reason it lands under is one of the three the operator's next move
    differs between, chosen by which probe found the violation, so the pinned
    record still says whether there are commits to reset off, edits to clean,
    or a checkout that could not be read at all. That last one comes with no
    reset target on purpose: the read that would have named one is the thing
    that failed, and quoting the anchor would tell an operator to run a command
    over a tree nobody has established anything about. All of them are why this
    park is written once: the reason it leaves IS a repair request, so the tick
    after it holds quietly rather than repeating itself. The reply is left
    unconsumed either way, so answering it again is not something the human has
    to think to do.

    A commit that IS the agreed plan never reaches here: the reply publishes it
    instead, which is what keeps a tick that died between opening the plan PR
