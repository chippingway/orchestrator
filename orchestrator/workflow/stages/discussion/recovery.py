"""Carrying a publication a tick died in the middle of to an ending.

The marker a publication writes before it touches anything is what makes the
step re-runnable, and reading it is the whole of this owner's job. It names the
tip that was about to be published, and everything after that write can leave
the world changed -- the remote is asked, the branch is pushed, the PR is
opened -- so a later tick finding this branch mid-publication has to know
whether the commit on it is one this stage began publishing or one that merely
looks like a plan. The marker is what says so.

Once set it answers for the branch itself: the publication is resumed when the
tip is still the commit it named and that commit still validates, and refused
otherwise. What a MOVED tip can mean is the whole difficulty -- a publication
that merged elsewhere, an open one the humans pushed past, a branch an operator
reset, or a second plan-shaped commit nobody here began -- and telling those
apart takes the remote as well as the local reading, because a push sends the
SHA it validated rather than `HEAD` and can therefore land without the local
ref ever moving.

This runs ahead of the turn-taking gate in `handler`, which is why the batch
that drove the tick is handed in to be consumed here: the marker's write
persists whatever the round staged, the consumed watermark included, so an
issue whose publication crashed after that point is parked with no unread
answer and would otherwise wait for a human to say the same thing twice.

    an operator, and retrying every tick would push at a remote already

    retries it, which is also the operator saying they fixed the reason.

    spends the reply -- so what reaches here still carrying the failure is a

    """Decide a marker whose tip is no longer the commit it names.

    Refused rather than declined, because the alternatives all publish
    something nobody proved: a tip that has moved is a second plan-shaped
    commit this stage never began publishing, and letting the readings below
    take it for a round's own work would credit a design to a conversation that
    never agreed to one.

    That refusal is written once. Its own reason is what the repeat reads, so
    an operator who restores the commit the marker names finds it published on
    the next tick, and one who does not is not told again every poll. A branch
    reset back to the round's anchor is the second answer: it carries nothing
    to publish, so the marker is spent rather than enforced, and the
    conversation is free to continue from the reply that has been waiting on it.

    A publication that MERGED is settled before either of those, and settled by
    recording rather than by publishing. The checkout it is read from can be
    one rebuilt at base -- the merge deletes the branch, so a host that lost the
    worktree and the local ref has nowhere else to rebuild from -- and that tip
    is neither the commit the marker names nor the round's anchor. Left to the
    readings below it is a branch somebody moved, and the issue parks on that
    forever with no `pr_number` and no plan path ever written, while the plan
    it is parked about is in the base branch. So the pull request itself is
    asked for by commit, and finding it finishes the publication the crash
    interrupted. An OPEN one the humans have pushed past is the same answer for
    the same reason, and is settled in the same place.

    That question is the one this cannot proceed without an answer to. Both
    readings under it act on the marker -- one spends it, the other refuses on
    it for good -- and each is a claim about whether the plan was published
    that a failed commit-list read cannot support.

    The reset reading is a claim about the REMOTE, though, and only the remote
    can make it. The push names the commit it sends rather than `HEAD`, so a
    plan committed on a detached head goes out while the local ref never moves,
    and a restore later prefers that local ref over the head it just fetched --
    so a publication that landed and a publication that was reset away look the
    same from here. Spent on that reading, the plan stays open on a pull
    request nobody recorded and the conversation opens another round over the
    top of it. So the marker is only spent once the branch the remote holds can
    be shown not to carry the commit it names.

    A pull request the humans CLOSED without merging is the one answer that
    waits for that reading rather than preceding it, because it is the only one
    the reset can also explain. An operator answering the stale park may well
    close the stray pull request while they are resetting the branch, and a
    close read as a verdict there would finish the issue on debris they were
    tidying. So it is taken up only once the reset has been ruled out -- the
    branch is not back at the anchor, or the remote still carries the commit --
    and then it IS the verdict: the plan is out there, the humans turned it
    down, and `terminal` finishes the issue `rejected` from the record this
    writes. Refused instead, the issue parks on a stale publication forever
    with no number, no label, no event, and no branch anything will reap, which
    is exactly what a reviewer who amends the plan and then closes it leaves
    behind.

    True unless the remote can be SHOWN not to carry it, which is three

    the real absence: nothing of this stage's is published, and the marker is
    the caller's to spend -- the one way a deleted branch still means a
    published plan is a merge, and the caller has already recorded that pull
    request before anything reaches here. A tip equal to the commit itself

    request does exactly that --
