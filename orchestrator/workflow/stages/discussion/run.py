"""One agent round of a discussion, opening or resumed, and what it records.

The round runs in the issue's own `issue-N` worktree on its own branch rather
than in a scratch checkout of its own, because the design being discussed is
the design that branch will carry: an operator inspecting a park, and every
later round of the same conversation, look at the tree the discussion actually
read. Nothing here tears it down for that reason, and a resumed round reuses
the tree its predecessor left rather than rebuilding one over it.

Reusing that tree is why every probe here exists. `_stranded_worktree_state`
runs BEFORE the checkout is prepared, because preparing it force-removes a
dirty tree that carries no commits and wiping it would destroy the only
evidence an operator has -- and it reports whether git could be asked at all,
since a probe that never ran answers with the same emptiness a clean tree does
and the step behind it does not wait for proof. It is also asked before the
anchor comparison rather than after it, because that comparison's own `HEAD`
read can fail: unresolvable, it comes back empty and compares unequal to every
anchor, so a checkout nothing has established anything about would answer "a
round committed here" -- and a publication is what follows that answer.

Which restorer prepares it is decided by what may be on the
remote: once a PR is open, the branch under discussion is the one it is open
against, and a pruned local ref has to come back from the PR head rather than
from the base branch. A publication in flight says the same thing before there
is a `pr_number` to read it off -- the marker is written before the push and
the number only after the PR -- so that window is settled by asking the remote
whether the branch is there. `_head_sha` is read after the checkout is settled and
before the spawn, because the branch may already carry commits from a stage the
issue passed through before an operator relabeled it here; a base-relative
probe would read those as this round's work and park the agent for something it
never did. And `_round_anchor_moved` asks that same question a tick late, for
the rounds that never got to ask it themselves.

That last one is why the SHA is written down rather than only held. A round can
end without any disposition at all -- a mid-run `paused` withholds every one of
them by contract, and a crash takes them with it -- and the next tick then
reuses the same checkout, so a commit the ended round made would become the new
round's own baseline and read as work the branch arrived carrying. Recording
the SHA before the spawn is what keeps that classifiable: on an issue this
stage does not have parked, a non-empty anchor means a round opened and never
finished, and comparing it to the tree says whether it left a commit behind.
On a parked one the same comparison says something narrower and just as
load-bearing -- whether the checkout is still the certified one -- which the
handler asks of both probes here before a reply may open a round on it.

The spec rides that same pre-spawn write, so a run that returns no session id
-- a CLI hiccup, an empty `-o` file -- still records which backend and args this
issue's discussion ran under. It is read back on every later round rather than
re-resolved, because every round after the first is the same conversation: a
`DECOMPOSE_AGENT` flip between two of them must not move it onto a backend that
never ran here, and must not hand a session id opened on one CLI to another.
The session id is staged when it arrives and reaches GitHub with the park it
belongs to, so a round nobody will ever see never leaves a conversation pointer
behind -- and the next round resumes the last one that was actually published.

    Every park this stage writes suppresses the next tick, so work waiting in
    the tree at the top of a discussion tick came either from a round that died
    before it could park on what it wrote, or from the stage the issue was
    relabeled out of. Reading it here -- ahead of the `_ensure_worktree` that
    would force-remove exactly that tree -- is what lets the caller preserve it
    instead of recreating over it.

    The STATUS form of the read rather than the path list, because what follows
    a clean answer is destructive. The list form maps its own failure to "no
    paths", which is exactly what a clean tree reports, so a `git status` that
    could not run -- a corrupt index, a half-removed directory -- would read as
    a tree with nothing in it worth keeping and be force-removed before an
    operator ever saw why it failed. A tree nothing proved empty is not empty,
    and the post-round checks lean on this one having proved it.

    It is asked BEFORE the anchor comparison beside it for the same reason. An

    The anchor is what makes this answerable: it is written before the spawn
    and outlives every park, so what a moved tip MEANS is decided by the
    caller. On an issue this stage does not have parked it is a round withheld
    by a mid-run pause or cut short by a crash, and the movement is the commit
    it left. On a parked one the round did reach a disposition, and the
    movement is somebody having written on the branch since -- the same
    violation, minus the question of who. HEAD is compared against the anchor
    rather than against the base, so a branch that already carried commits when
    the issue was relabeled here stays innocent either way.

    A missing checkout falls back to the branch tip, for the same reason the
    read-only relabel guard consults the branch at all: a directory can be
    removed while the local branch survives carrying the commits, and
    `_ensure_worktree` would restore it under the next round as that round's
    own baseline. It is the tip of the branch the round RECORDED that is read,
    and it is compared rather than measured against base -- an issue relabeled
    here from a PR stage has a branch ahead of base whatever this stage did, and
    an issue pinned to a legacy branch has a slug-namespaced ref beside it whose
    unchanged tip says nothing about where the round actually ran.

    A `HEAD` that could not be read is neither, which is why the answer has a
    third value. It comes back empty, and empty compares unequal to every
    anchor there is -- so read as a move it would put the commit the branch
    already carried onto a pull request in this stage's name, attributed to a

    A publication in flight is the unsettled one, and it is why this is not

    The base goes with them, and it is read from the remote rather than off
