"""The plan's pull request, and the session every one of them has to name.

One is opened only when the branch does not already have an open one against
the base. A tick that died between `open_pr` and the pinned write left a pull
request up with nothing pointing at it, and the next tick re-derives the same
publishable artifact from the same branch -- so asking for the open one first
is what turns that replay into a reuse instead of a duplicate GitHub would 422,
and why the `pr_opened` event is emitted only on the branch that really opened
one, so a recovered publication is not counted twice.

What comes back from that lookup is only guaranteed to be open on this branch
against this base, never that anything here opened it. A human can open one by
hand on the branch the plan was pushed to, and an issue can arrive at this
stage with one already up. So the reuse fixes up the body rather than trusting
it, and what it checks for is the named SESSION: that line is the whole reason
the body exists, since it is what lets a reviewer follow a published plan back
to the conversation that agreed it. Its presence leaves everything else the
body says alone, including a human's own additions to ours.

Which is why a plan nothing can attribute is refused before any of this, on
every path that touches a pull request. A round that opened a NEW conversation
drops the previous pin before it spawns and records the id it opened only when
it reports, so one cut short in between leaves a valid plan commit with no
session to name -- and every ending is wrong for it.
