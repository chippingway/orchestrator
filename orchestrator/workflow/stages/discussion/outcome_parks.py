"""The endings that report what the agent run itself produced.

Nothing here reads the tree or the branch: a round that wrote is settled by the
checkout and publication owners beside this one, and what is left over is what
the backend handed back -- a run that ran out of time, one that returned with
nothing to say, and the analysis a finished round posts for the humans to
answer by number. The last of those is the stage's ordinary ending rather than
a failure, and it parks for the same reason all of them do: the next move is a
human's, and the reason prefix is what tells the next tick so.
