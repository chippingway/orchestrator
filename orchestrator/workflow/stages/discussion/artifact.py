"""What the branch carries, read once from the checkout the round ran in.

This stage publishes from an artifact rather than from a claim. The agent is
told to write `plans/issue-N.md` only after a human confirms on the thread that
the two of them understand the design the same way, and nothing here can check
that a human said so -- what it can check is what the branch now carries. So
the check IS the contract: a tree that could be read and is clean, a
base-relative diff of exactly that one path, and the plan itself present in
HEAD. A missing plan, a deleted one, a second one, a code or configuration
change, anything left uncommitted beside it, or a worktree that could not be
inspected at all means the round did something other than write down what was
agreed -- or that nothing here can tell -- and none of those is pushed.

`_plan_artifact` takes that reading once and hands it around whole, because the
same paths that decide are the paths the refusal quotes -- and because the tree
that was inspected has to be the tree that is pushed. It reads the checkout the
round ran in, restoring one only when the directory has gone: a dirty tree is
never recreated over, since it is the evidence the operator was parked to look
at.

What the REMOTE's tip means is left to each owner that asks for one, since a
tip that has moved is a publication already finished to one of them and a
branch nobody may overwrite to another. Making that tip askable at all is here
all the same: what `_readable_remote_tip` establishes is an object in THIS
checkout's store, so it belongs beside the worktree the artifact was taken from
rather than beside any one reading of it.

    Every probe is taken, not just enough of them to reach a verdict, because
    the reading is also what the refusal quotes: an operator told only the
    first thing that was wrong would fix it and be refused again for the next.
    They are three different questions -- what is loose in the tree, what the
    commits change against base, and whether the plan is in the commit at all
    -- and a branch can pass any two of them and still not be a design anyone
    agreed to.

    Whether HEAD is the BRANCH is read beside it, because what the push sends
    is a SHA and where it sends it is `refs/heads/<branch>`. A commit an agent
    made on a detached HEAD is a real commit in a real tree, and every other
    check here would pass it -- but the branch would still be where it was, so
    the ref this stage records, the ref the relabel guard measures, and the ref
    a lost checkout is rebuilt from would all be behind what the pull request
    carries. The reading is what refuses that rather than moving somebody
    else's ref to make it true.

    The tip is read once and then NAMED to the two commit-level probes rather
    than each re-reading `HEAD`. It is the commit this reading decides about
    and the commit the push publishes, and every `git` invocation between them
    is a moment the branch could move under: asked of `HEAD`, the checks could
    answer for one commit while the push sent another.

    The other end of that diff comes from pinned state, not from a ref. The
    round recorded what the remote said the base was before it spawned, and
    reading `<remote>/<base>` here instead would ask a local ref the agent's
    own worktree can move -- which is how a branch carrying a code commit and a
    plan commit could be made to look like a branch carrying only the plan.
