"""What keeps a multi-round discussion on one agent, and what each round is fed.

Every helper here exists because something between two rounds is allowed to
change underneath the conversation. The configured `DECOMPOSE_AGENT` can be
flipped, so the spec that actually ran is pinned and read back rather than
re-resolved -- and the session id travels with it, because a conversation is
only resumable on the CLI that opened it. The issue thread can gain an
untrusted reply, so one filter drops those before they can steer the agent OR
move the watermark. And the backend can hand back no session id at all, which
is why both prompt choices sit together: a round with nothing to resume gets
the full conversation rebuilt instead, since a followup handed to a fresh agent
would arrive with no issue body, no frontier, and no design to fold an answer
into. Both are handed the plan path this stage would publish, spelled by its
own key owner rather than by the prompt: a round with nothing cached can still
be the round the humans confirm on, and a path the agent is told that differs
from the path the publication check looks for would refuse every plan written
to it.

Reading the replies and consuming them are deliberately separate calls, and
`run` puts the round's provenance write between them. Nothing is consumed until
a round is actually being opened on it, so a tick that finds a reply and then
declines to spawn leaves the answer waiting rather than swallowing it; and the
advance is staged in memory afterwards, so it reaches GitHub only with the park
that reports what the round made of it. A round withheld by a mid-run pause or
cut short by a crash is therefore replayed against the same replies -- the same
promise the anchor beside it makes about the same round's commits.

What that advance is measured over is what the round's prompt was BUILT from,
never the thread as it stands when the park is written. Minutes pass inside an
agent run and a human can answer twice in them, so a ceiling taken afterwards
would record a comment nothing has read -- and this stage never reads a comment
twice, so it would be read never. The one thing that then has to be recognized
without a watermark is the stage's own posted analysis, which `engine/comments`
already stamps and records for exactly this: an id list for the comments still
in its bounded cap and a hidden body marker for the ones evicted from it.
Author-login matching is the alternative both readers refuse, since a PAT
shared with a human's account would swallow that human's real replies as bot
noise.

    can be replayed -- a mid-run pause, an interruption, or a crash ends one
