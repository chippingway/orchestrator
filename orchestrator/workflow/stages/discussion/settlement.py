"""What the checkout holds, and whose the commit on it is.

The reading is taken once rather than as two questions asked in either order,
because the second is only answerable while the first says the checkout can be
read at all. A tree `git status` could not report on and a `HEAD` that would
not resolve are each a checkout nothing has been established about, and what
sits behind the moved question is a publication: empty compares unequal to
every anchor there is, so the reading nobody could take would answer "a round
committed here" the loudest of any.

What follows it is an ownership question, and it is the same question on both
roads in. A moved tip says only that the branch is no longer where this stage's
last round opened it; it does not say who put the commit there. The open-round
record is what says that, because it is written durably before the spawn and
cleared by every park: true of exactly the rounds a crash or a mid-run pause
left unreported, and false of the commit an issue arrived carrying from a stage
it passed through before an operator relabeled it here. Reading the second as
the first would put a commit no conversation here ever saw onto a plan PR under
this stage's own session.

A commit this stage owns is settled exactly as the round that made it would
have settled it -- the agreed plan published, anything else parked with what
the branch actually carries -- and one it does not own is reported instead. The
two roads differ only in what that report costs: under a park this stage wrote,
the paths and the reset command are already on the thread, so a tree that was
wrong before the reply arrived is not described to the humans a second time.

    A park normally means this stage's round is over, so what appeared on the

    argued out is not one to open a PR for on a human's next reply, least of
    all on a reply that rejects it. Two records say otherwise, and they are
    the two ways this stage can be mid-something under a park.

    A publication in flight is one of them, and by the time anything reaches
    here it has already answered for the branch either way: the caller asks it
    ahead of every local reading, since it is finished when the tip is still
    the commit it named -- one whose push failed and is being retried by this
    reply, or one whose PR was opened by a tick that died before recording it,
    where reporting a violation would tell an operator to reset away a plan a
    pull request may already be open against -- and refused when the tip is
    anything else, since a commit that turned up over an unfinished publication
    is no more this stage's than one that turned up over a park.

    An open round is the second record, and the one left to read here: a
    resumed round runs with the previous park still durable, so one that
    committed the agreed plan and was then paused or cut short is judged the
    same way `_settle_moved_checkout` judges the crash it recovers.
