"""How a discussion stops being worked, and what it holds on to until then.

The published plan is what ends this conversation, and the pull request
carrying it is the only thing that says how. So the tick opens by asking
GitHub about that pull request, ahead of every local reading and every path
that could spawn: an issue whose design the humans have already taken or
turned down must not have another round opened over the top of it, and the
answer to "which of the two" is not on this host.

Three answers, and the two terminal ones share the tail every other stage's
terminals use -- the timestamp, the label, the usage receipt before the write,
the event, and the close -- because a discussion that finished is finished the
same way a review that finished is. A merged plan PR is the humans agreeing to
the design, which is `done`; one closed without merging is them declining it,
which is `rejected`. Both name `discussion` as the stage, since that is the
label the issue is sitting on and what an audit row has to attribute the run
to.

An OPEN one is the third answer and the reason this owner exists at all. It
changes nothing -- no label, no write, no comment -- and, crucially, it takes
nothing down: the worktree and the branches the plan lives on are what the pull
request is open against, and reaping them while a human is still reading the
plan would close their review out from under them. That holds whether or not
the ISSUE is still open. An operator who closes the issue while its plan PR is
up has said nothing about the plan, so the stage keeps the label it was on --
which is what leaves the issue inside the closed-issue sweep -- and waits for
the pull request itself to say which terminal applies. Flipping it to a
terminal label there would end the sweep's interest in the issue on the one
reading nobody has taken yet, and the branch would outlive every pass that
knows to clean it up.

A pull request that could not be fetched is that same hold: nothing is decided
on a read that failed, and the tick after this one asks again. What it must
never do is fall through, since "GitHub declined once" would otherwise open a
round on a design that has already been agreed.

A closed issue with NO recorded pull request is where the marker is read, and
it is read before anything is finalized. `discussion_publishing_sha` names a
commit a publication began pushing, and the window between the pull request
being opened and its number being written is one a human can decide inside: a
tick that died there leaves a real pull request with nothing pinned pointing
at it. Taken for a discussion that never published, an OPEN one would have the
issue flipped to a terminal label -- out of the closed-issue sweep, with its
branch and worktree left for nothing to reap -- while its plan sat on a pull
request still waiting for a review nobody would come back for. So the marker's
commit is asked about across every state, and what comes back decides: a
decided pull request is finalized here (its number recorded first, since that
is what the tail names and what cleanup resolves the branch from), an open one
holds exactly as a recorded one does, and a lookup nobody could take decides
nothing at all.

Only once that answer is "there is no pull request" is the close the whole
signal. It finalizes to `rejected` -- the human stop signal, recorded the way
every other stage records it -- and that flip is what takes the issue back out
of the sweep, which would otherwise re-surface it on every pass forever.
Nothing is torn down there: the branch may be carrying an unpublished plan
commit, or belong to a pull request this issue merely arrived here holding, and
this stage does not delete either on the strength of a closed issue alone.

An OPEN issue is not asked any of that. Its unfinished publication belongs to
`publication`, which finishes the push, adopts the pull request already
carrying the commit, and records what it found -- and which refuses to publish
over one the humans have decided, so the terminal above sees it on the tick
after.
