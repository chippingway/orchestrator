"""Putting the PR worktree back on the real PR head, or refusing to continue.

Every step here fails closed, and the thing it is failing closed against is
specific: a local docs commit authored before the body edit is exactly what the
next tick's recovered-commit shortcut would push without spawning an agent, and
under `SQUASH_ON_APPROVAL=off` it would apply cleanly on top of the next
approval. So a fetch, probe, reset, or clean that cannot prove the worktree is
back on `<remote>/<branch>` parks the issue rather than letting the unwind
report success.

The ahead/behind probe is spelled out here rather than reached through the
shared divergence reading, and what it buys is the DETAIL: this park is the one
an operator has to debug a git invocation from, so the exit code, stderr, and
stdout the probe answered with go into the log beside it. Both fail closed --
neither reports a reading that did not happen as a clean worktree, which is
what would let the stale commit survive. The reset is paired with `git clean -fd` because
`reset --hard` leaves untracked files -- and a docs agent's output is often a
new file or a new directory under `docs/` that no reviewer ever approved.
