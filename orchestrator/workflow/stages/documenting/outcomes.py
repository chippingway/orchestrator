"""Reading a finished docs run, in the order the checks have to happen.

A timeout is answered first because nothing the run left on disk can be
trusted. The dirty-tree check is second and blocks every outcome after it: a
push ships only committed work, so an agent that edited files without
committing would have its edits silently dropped by the publication path and
silently abandoned by the no-change and question paths alike. Only then does
the `before_sha` comparison get to say whether THIS run produced a commit.

On a clean tree with no new commit the agent either checked the diff and found
nothing to write, or it stopped for some other reason. The explicit
`DOCS: NO_CHANGE` marker is the only thing that distinguishes the two -- an
absent marker is not agreement, so anything else parks for a human rather than
advancing an issue whose docs were never actually reviewed.
