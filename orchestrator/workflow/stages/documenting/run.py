"""Getting the branch ready, and the three shapes one docs pass arrives in.

The remote-tracking ref is refreshed before the ahead/behind check because the
eventual push is `--force-with-lease` against the LOCAL view of the remote: a
stale ref reads "in sync" and the lease then clobbers a PR head somebody else
moved. Being behind is refused outright for the same reason.

Which shape runs is decided in priority order. An awaiting-human park belongs
to the human's reply, and it reruns the FULL documentation prompt rather than a
followup built from the new comments alone -- a `fetch_failed` or `agent_timeout`
resume may be the first time this session sees the docs contract at all, and a
session that only remembers `DOCS: NO_CHANGE` from an earlier spawn would
advance the issue without ever checking the diff. A worktree already ahead of
the remote is a push an earlier tick was interrupted before finishing, so it
synthesizes a result and spawns nothing. Everything else is a fresh pass.

Both spawning shapes persist `docs_checked_sha` BEFORE the run, because a
no-change verdict afterwards is only trustworthy against the head the agent was
actually handed, and both go through the shared dev resume rather than a bare
agent call so the docs pass participates in session rotation and overflow
recovery instead of replaying the whole transcript untracked.

Whichever shape runs, the verdict an EARLIER pass left is dropped as this one
begins. That re-anchored `docs_checked_sha` is what makes it necessary: paired
with a stale verdict it says a pass has FINISHED for the head this one is only
now starting on, and the in_review merge gate reads that pair as a head this
orchestrator has documented and pings it as ready for a human to merge.
