"""The relabel to `in_review`, and the handoff that brought the issue here.

The one this stage was handed is the shorter story and it opens the tick. A
`validating` approval settles a finished squash into `late_collapse_handoff_sha`
and moves the label behind that write, so a record still standing when this
stage runs is one whose relabel DID land and whose cleanup write did not. This
stage running is the proof of that, and it is the only proof there is -- the
label history cannot tell a move that never happened from one this stage later
unwound -- so the record is ended here rather than left for a validating tick
to read as a move it still owes and answer a re-review by relabelling the
unchanged head straight back.

Both docs outcomes -- a pushed commit and a confirmed no-change -- leave the
approval, squash, and PR watermarks validating wrote untouched and advance to
`in_review`. What they cannot leave untouched is `pr_last_comment_id`. The
awaiting-human resume advances `last_action_comment_id` past the human reply it
fed into the docs prompt, but in_review scans `comments_after(issue,
pr_last_comment_id)` and only falls back to `last_action_comment_id` when that
field is None. A `pr_last_comment_id` validating seeded BEFORE the reply would
therefore replay it as fresh PR feedback and bounce the issue to `fixing` over
work the dev already did.

The ratchet reuses validating's own seed-walk so a PR-conversation comment
sitting between the old watermark and the consumed-through threshold is not
swallowed: the walk stops at the first unread non-orchestrator comment on
either surface, and the consumed-through bound applies to the issue thread
only. `max` keeps a higher in_review watermark from regressing, and a PR fetch
failure is best-effort -- the handoff still advances, and in_review's own
rescan is debounced and correct on its own.

The pinned write comes next and the relabel last, because the relabel is the
one effect that takes the issue off the stage that could finish what a crash
interrupted. `in_review` repairs nothing: relabelled first, a process dying
before the write leaves the merge gate reading a `docs_checked_sha` that names
the commit the pass began on and a `docs_verdict` nobody wrote, and the ready
ping never fires again for that head.

    `last_action_comment_id` past the human reply it fed into the
    `_build_documentation_prompt` resume. The final-docs handoff then
    relabels to `in_review`, which scans `comments_after(issue,
    pr_last_comment_id)` and falls back to `last_action_comment_id`
    only when `pr_last_comment_id is None`. Without this ratchet a
    `pr_last_comment_id` validating seeded BEFORE the human's reply
    keeps the older value, the consumed reply replays as fresh PR
    feedback, and in_review bounces the issue to `fixing` over work
    the dev has already addressed.

    Reuse `_latest_pr_comment_ids` (the same seed-walk validating uses

    tick's higher watermark is never regressed.

    A PR fetch failure is treated as best-effort: log and skip, so the
