"""One documenting tick, in the order its questions have to be asked.

The preconditions come first because each of them makes the spawn pointless or
unanchored. Drift comes next, ahead of the parked-no-input fast path, so a body
edit still unwinds an issue that is sitting parked -- the reverse order would
leave a stale approval standing behind a park nobody replied to.

After the run the order matters just as much: the interruption and live-pause
refusals both precede the disposition and both return WITHOUT writing pinned
state, so the mutations the pass staged -- the advanced watermark, the
pre-spawn `docs_checked_sha` -- are discarded and the next process re-derives
the tick from what durable state still says. Committed docs work stays on the
branch and republishes through the recovered-commit shortcut.
