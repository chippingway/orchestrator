"""The frozen records one documenting tick hands between its owners.

`_DocumentingContext` exists so the drift-unwind, worktree-prep, run, and
disposition owners thread one value instead of up to six positional arguments.
`branch` and `pr_number` are tick-invariant once the missing-`pr_number` guard
has passed, so every consumer downstream of it reads them off the context
rather than re-deriving a branch name the pinned state may already override.

`_DocumentingRun` carries what the disposition cannot re-derive after the fact:
`before_sha` is the only thing that tells a commit this run produced from one
already on the branch, `recovered` distinguishes the shortcut that spawned no
agent, and `ahead` is what makes a `DOCS: NO_CHANGE` verdict over a recovered
commit still push it instead of advancing with the docs stranded locally.
