"""What a docs pass leaves on the PR, and the order it is written in.

Both surviving outcomes end the same way -- stamp the watermarks, post the
notice, hand off -- but the push comes first and gates everything after it. A
failed push parks instead of advancing, because a `docs_verdict` stamped over
a commit that never reached the remote would tell the next tick the docs are
published when the reviewer would never see them in the diff. That is also why
a `DOCS: NO_CHANGE` verdict over a recovered commit still routes through the
push path rather than the clean one.

`docs_checked_sha` records the head the verdict was formed against and the
silent-park counter is reset alongside it, so a park streak that predates a
successful pass cannot later rotate a healthy session. The PR notice itself is
best-effort: a comment failure must not strand an issue whose branch is already
published and whose state is already stamped.

Every terminal success ends the same way too, and the order is the whole of the
crash contract: stamp, announce, persist, relabel -- one durable write, and the
relabel behind it. The notice comes before the write because posting one
RECORDS it: the comment id lands in `orchestrator_comment_ids`, which is what
keeps the watermark walk and the in_review feedback scan from reading our own
post as human feedback, and there is nothing behind the write to carry it. The
write comes before the relabel because `in_review` repairs nothing it is
handed: relabelled first, a crash in between leaves the merge gate reading the
head the pass BEGAN on and a verdict nobody wrote, on a stage whose own handler
never looks at either.

Two windows are left and both fail toward doing the work again rather than
skipping it. A tick that posted its notice and died over the write comes back
with nothing on the record saying so, and the tick that finishes the handoff
from the receipt announces it a second time. And a tick whose relabel did not
land comes back to a pass this write already called finished, with the receipt
it dropped: nothing tells that state from a `validating` approval handing the
same head back, so the pass runs again rather than handing off on a receipt
that could belong to either.

    A docs commit is a candidate for a pull request the remote already carries
    like any other, so the size gate stands in front of this push too. It is
    the last one before a human is asked to merge, which is what makes it
    matter rather than what makes it an exception: a pass that took the diff
    past the ceiling would put an unadjudicated pull request in front of the
    person who merges it. A held candidate ends the tick -- the gate has
    parked the issue or handed it to the adjudication, and the `in_review`
    handoff below would move it off the state the gate just set -- but the
    pass itself is over, so the head it produced is handed to the gate as the

    read it as an issue no docs pass has run for, and spawn a second one over
    a commit the first pass already published.

    it whichever way the answer went -- so a push that landed and a process

    The receipt says the pass is over: an agent ran, it committed, and the
    only thing left between that commit and `in_review` is the handoff. The
    gate HELD the commit, and a settled `single` verdict publishes it from the
    adjudication and hands the label back here. Or the gate ALLOWED the push,
    it landed, and the tick died before this stage could record it -- the
    receipt goes down in the gate's own write either way, which is ahead of
    everything this stage does with a landed push.

    It is the write that RECORDS the pass which drops it, so a receipt read
    here is one no handoff has been made for. Kept past that write to cover
    the relabel behind it as well, it would outlive the handoff whenever the
    write that dropped it did not land -- and a later approval at that same
    head would consume it, skipping the docs pass it just bought.

    Running the docs agent again instead of finishing from a live receipt
    would commit a second time over work that is already published, which the
    gate would measure and could route to an adjudication.

    `ahead` is what says the commit reached the remote, and it is asked
    because the receipt cannot: a verdict that parked, or a human who moved
    the label by hand, leaves the same receipt over a commit still on disk
    only. Ahead of the remote the receipt is left exactly where it is and the
    recovered-commit path below republishes it through the gate, which is the
    one road that measures it again.

    In sync is not the same claim as CARRYING it. A replacement host rebuilds
    the checkout from a pull request that has moved on, and what it gets is a
    branch level with its remote and standing on somebody else's head -- so
    the receipt is proved against the commit the checkout is on, not merely
    against the counters. That proof carries the remote with it: the caller
    fetched the branch before counting and parks a checkout behind it, so a
    head that is in sync AND is the settled commit says the remote is
    standing there too.

    id is not one a checkout can be compared to, and a head this host cannot
