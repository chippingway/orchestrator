"""The four ways a documenting tick stops and waits for a human.

Three of them go through `_park_documenting`, which re-stamps `park_reason`
after the shared HITL park cleared it: the tag is what a later tick branches on
-- the awaiting-human resume reads it to tell a stale flag from a live park,
`/orchestrator continue` keys its retry-or-refuse decision off it, and the
refresh loop recognizes its own auto-rebase reasons in it. The fourth, the
missing-`pr_number` park, is the one that must not repeat: it fires on a label
an operator applied by hand and would otherwise re-post on every poll, so
`awaiting_human` alone gates it.

The dirty-tree and question parks defer to the implementing owner rather than
composing their own notice, because both carry state this stage does not model
-- the classified reason and the silent-park streak that eventually rotates a
poisoned session, and the dirty-file count that rides on the event. Every park
here writes pinned state, so the caller returns unconditionally.
