"""What has to be settled before a docs agent may spawn.

Three of these end the tick outright. A PR merged or an issue closed out of
band means the docs pass would run against work that has already landed or
been abandoned, so both are read before anything spends tokens. A
`documenting` label with no pinned `pr_number` has nothing to anchor on. And a
content-free `/orchestrator continue` has to be classified here, ahead of the
drift and resume paths, because documenting keeps no preserved feedback batch
to replay: a bare continue either retries a session failure by rerunning the
whole documentation prompt or it needs a human's actual words, and only the
second one is refused.

The fourth is the quiet one: an already-parked issue with no new trusted reply
returns before the fetch and ahead/behind probe, so a transient park does not
re-post its comment on every poll and an outsider's comment cannot wake a docs
pass an allowlist was meant to keep them out of.
