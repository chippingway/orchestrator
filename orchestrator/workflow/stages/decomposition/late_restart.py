"""The fresh attempt an operator authorizes once a cancelled cycle has ended.

A cancellation is irreversible within its cycle, so nothing gets that cycle
back and the only way into ordinary work is a new one. The authorization for
it is a GESTURE rather than a state: a settled cancellation hands its owner
`rejected`, an issue wearing that is inert everywhere, and taking it off is a
label write GitHub grants only to a repository's own people. So the handshake
is the operator reopening the issue and removing the label, and this owner is
what that removal turns into.

**What proves it is the pinned comment, and nothing on the issue's surface.**
An unlabeled issue is all the surface shows, and three different things wear
that same nothing: an operator who took `rejected` off, a human who stripped a
workflow label while the cleanup was still running, and an ending whose
terminal write GitHub refused. So the record has to say three things -- the
cycle was cancelled, it owes nothing, and its `rejected` is proved to be ON
the issue. The last is the proof half of the ending's two-phase terminal
record, and what it is not is an attempt: the decision to write the label goes
down before the write, and only a label that actually landed makes the removal
of one mean anything.

An unlabeled issue whose record says anything else is not this owner's
business, and it is not ordinary work either: a cancellation still owing the
remote a branch, a ref, a child receipt, or a plan pull request belongs to the
cleanup until it does not, and one whose terminal is unproved is owed that
terminal first. Every one of those is refused by the guard beside this one
rather than let through, because the pickup path behind them greets an issue
as new and mints a SECOND pinned comment -- shadowed by the first from the
moment it is written, while the finished workflow in that first one goes on
deciding. A rejection from anywhere else in the workflow is refused there for
the same reason, and stays exactly as inert as it was.

"Owes nothing" is one question over two readings, asked of the cancellation
owner so this guard and that one cannot disagree. A plan pull request this
generation names and cannot prove it held is a record only a human can repair,
carried on no ledger and reported only by the ending; a child receipt and an
untypeable consumer ledger are obligations only the domain's settled-ledger
answer counts. Either reading alone would let a restart erase a hold, or reach
its retirement and be refused there with the marker already down.

**The gesture is the authorization, which is why the author allowlist is not
asked.** `ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS` guards the one path a stranger reaches on
their own -- an unlabeled issue picked up automatically -- and what it
protects is agent budget on a public repository. Nobody reaches THIS path by
filing an issue: it takes a pinned comment only this orchestrator writes, and
a label removal only a repository's own people may make. The fresh attempt is
therefore authorized by whoever made that gesture rather than by whoever filed
the issue, so an outsider's issue an operator has decided to restart is
restarted.

**It is a transaction over the one pinned comment, and the order is what makes
it safe to repeat.** The marker goes down first -- the cycle this restart
intends, the cycle it succeeds, and the label it means to apply -- because a
tick that died between the write and the effects has to resume THAT cycle
rather than mint a second one and say so twice. Then the two external effects:
the notice, suppressed by its own cycle-scoped marker on the thread, and the
target label, skipped only where this orchestrator is the one already wearing
it on the issue. Only once both have reconciled is the marker retired, and
retiring is what projects the fresh cycle.

**The label write is also the separator between cycles.** The ending beside
this one has one last-resort proof for a terminal no pass recorded -- the
newest workflow label THIS orchestrator applied -- and what makes that answer
belong to the cycle asking is that a restart always leaves a later application
of its own after the `rejected` it was authorized by. A target somebody else
put on the issue in the meantime is therefore not accepted as that
application: GitHub records no event for a label already present, so the name
comes off and goes back on rather than being written over.

Which label is applied is the CURRENT `DECOMPOSE` setting's answer at the
moment the marker is written -- `workflow:decomposing` while decomposition is
on, `workflow:implementing` when the switch is off -- and it is then the
marker's answer, not the switch's. A restart half-applied under one setting
and resumed under the other finishes the label it announced, because the
notice on the thread already told a human where the issue was going.

**The projection is a whitelist, not a list of deletions.** What survives is
what is true about the ISSUE rather than about the attempt: the pinned
comment's own identity, the bounded ids of the comments this orchestrator
posted, the cumulative usage the issue has already paid for, and the identity
the fresh cycle is joined to its predecessor by. Everything else goes -- every
session, the pull request and branch, the children and the dependency graph,
the snapshot, the whole previous generation and its cancellation, the parks,
the drift baseline, the counters, and the timestamps -- and the lineage and
generation go back to zero, because a restarted issue is a fresh attempt with
room to split rather than a cancelled one wearing a new number. Listing what
to drop instead would leave every key a later stage adds behind by default,
which is how a fresh cycle inherits a park nobody set or a branch nobody
pushed.

**A control label defers the whole of it.** `backlog` and `paused` park an
issue outside the state machine, and every step here is a write somebody
asked not to happen. Nothing is half-done meanwhile: the issue is held where
it is, and the restart is entered again on the tick the label comes off.

    The cycle has to exist and to be one a close already ended, and then three

    It has to owe nothing, which is `_unsettled` on the cancellation owner --
    one question over two readings, because neither contains the other. What
    the ending lists counts a plan pull request this generation names and
    cannot show it ever held, an obligation no ledger entry carries and only a
    human can repair; projecting the fresh cycle over one would delete the
    last thing on the issue pointing at a pull request this orchestrator left
    marked and open. What the domain's settled-ledger answer adds is a child
    receipt and a consumer ledger this binary could not type, and a restart
    that reached its retirement over one of those would be refused there with
    the marker already down and the label already applied. Asking the
    cancellation owner rather than restating its rule is what keeps the two
    guards exactly complementary: the tick that stops here is the tick that
    guard runs its ending on, and no state falls between them.

    The terminal has to be PROVED applied, which the record says and the label
    cannot. `rejected` is what an operator removes to authorize a fresh cycle,

    whose workflow label a human stripped while the cleanup was still running,

    nobody made. So it is the PROOF half of the terminal record that answers
    here -- the receipt a pass writes for a `rejected` it can see on the issue
    -- and not the decision half, which is only an attempt.

    And the gesture itself is read off the issue: an OPEN issue wearing no
    workflow label at all is one an operator reopened and took that terminal
    off, which is the only way a stamped cycle loses it. A closed one is the
    cleanup sweep's, whatever its record says.

    A marker already standing answers the gesture and the stamp for itself,
