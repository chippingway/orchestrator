"""The label an in-flight generation pins, and the two ways it is taken away.

An oversized committed candidate is adjudicated under `workflow:decomposing`,
and while that is open the label is not a state anything else may set. Both
ways it can be moved are the same move dressed differently, and both amount to
publishing the candidate without adjudicating it -- which is the one outcome
the whole size gate exists to prevent.

The kill switch is the first. `DECOMPOSE=off` routes a `decomposing` issue
into the legacy implementing flow, which is exactly right for an issue that
was only ever waiting to be decomposed and exactly wrong for one whose
implementation is already committed and measured past the ceiling: the switch
would turn a live question into a `single` verdict nobody recorded. So the
route is refused while a generation is live, for the same reason the
half-finished recovery beside it keeps running -- a kill switch that strands
or force-publishes existing work is not what off should mean. Turning it off
still stops new candidates from ever entering the gate; it does not decide the
ones already in it.

A human relabelling by hand is the second, and it is caught a step later than
the switch is, because there is nothing to refuse at the write: the
orchestrator never sees a human move a label, and by the time anything reads
one the old value is gone. So the refusal happens where a label becomes a
handler call. The dispatcher asks this owner before it routes anything, the
issue is put back to `workflow:decomposing` and told why, and it is left for
the next tick rather than handed to the stage the new label named. Idempotent
by construction -- a label already correct is left alone and says nothing -- so
the notice appears once per relabel rather than once per tick, and the refusal
stands even when the label write itself fails.

Neither of these clears, cancels, or decides anything. A generation an
operator really wants gone is cancelled through the late domain's own
cancellation, which records what was owed; coercing it through a label or a
switch would leave the plan-PR hold, the frozen commit, and the external
ledgers behind with nothing on the issue pointing at them.

What counts as in-flight is deliberately wider than "oversized". A read this
generation still owes is a question as open as the size one, and it is the
one an undersized revision leaves behind: the candidate no longer trips the
ceiling, so every gate keyed to size waves it through while nobody has
established that the issue is still there. Both doors are shut on it until
that read is reconciled or the cycle is cancelled.
