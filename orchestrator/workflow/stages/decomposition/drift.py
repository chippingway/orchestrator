"""What a body edit resets on an issue that is already `decomposing`.

The reset runs at the very top of the tick, ahead of the half-finished
recovery, because the manifest markers recovery reads are exactly what an edit
invalidates: a body rewritten during a crash window would otherwise be
finalized to `blocked` or `umbrella` against a split the human has already
moved on from. Everything the fresh spawn would read back is wiped in one
step -- the children, the dep graph, the expected count, the seal that says
that count is final, the umbrella flag, and the park flags -- so the tick
falls through and re-derives a manifest against the updated body rather than
returning the way the pre-implementation drift routes do.

Two things survive it. The locked agent spec stays, since a mid-flight
`DECOMPOSE_AGENT` flip must not retarget an issue whose pinned session id was
written by another backend; only the session id is retired, and through the
session owner, which is where that retirement is spelled for every caller that
decides the next run is a fresh one. Children the wiped manifest tracked stay
open on GitHub: the orchestrator stops tracking them, so the notice names them
as orphans and leaves it to the operator to decide which no longer apply.

The notice is posted before the reset touches state, so a tick that dies
between the two re-detects the same edit next time rather than throwing a
manifest away nobody was told about.
