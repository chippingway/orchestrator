"""The requirements a frozen candidate was measured against, fingerprinted.

Two digests, local to one late generation, and neither of them is the global
`user_content_hash`. That hash keeps a single baseline per issue and drives the
re-decompose and dev-resume routes every other stage depends on, so folding a
late question into it would move a baseline those routes read and fire a drift
they were not asking about. What late adjudication needs is a different
reading of the same thread: not "did anything the human wrote change" but
"which of the two things changed", because the two are answered in opposite
directions. A title or body edit changes what the candidate is supposed to BE
and is a reason to stop; trusted conversation arriving after the freeze is a
human answering and is a reason to go on.

So the title and body are digested on their own, and the trusted thread is
digested beside a watermark naming the last comment counted into it. The
watermark is what makes "new" a question with an answer -- a digest can say
that something moved, never which comment moved it -- and it is a ratchet
rather than a maximum recomputed from the thread, because a comment a human
deleted must not put it back down and let already-consumed guidance read as
fresh.

"New" and "an answer" are still not the same thing, which is why a reply is
read against a floor of its own: the higher of that watermark and the
issue-wide `last_action_comment_id`, which every announced park advances past
the notice it posted. A comment written before a park cannot be a reply to it
-- the human had not been told anything yet -- so a park that fires while
somebody is mid-sentence is not resolved on the next tick by the sentence they
had already sent.

The counted prefix is digested rather than trusted to the watermark alone, and
that is what catches the edit nothing else would see: a comment already folded
into the baseline, rewritten in place, moves no id at all. Reading that as
drift is deliberate. It is a change to the requirements with no new comment to
read it out of, which is exactly what a title edit is, so it is answered the
same way rather than lost.

Neither digest is taken here. Both are the `late_split/identity` owner's --
the domain that already spells what a late generation is keyed by, hashing
discipline included -- so this owner decides WHICH content is fingerprinted
and that one decides what a fingerprint IS. Two SHA-256 implementations of
one contract is exactly the drift the single owner exists to prevent.

Who counts is the same trust policy the global hash applies, asked through the
same filter: the pinned-state comment, the orchestrator's own marker and its
recorded ids, third-party bots, and every author outside `ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS`
are dropped before anything is digested. Nothing an outsider posts can shift a
fingerprint, become guidance, or move the watermark. A comment with no usable
id is dropped for a narrower reason: the watermark is what would consume it,
and a comment nothing can watermark would read as fresh guidance on every tick
forever.
