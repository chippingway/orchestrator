"""The order a `split` manifest becomes child issues in, and why it is that order.

Creating a child issue is not undoable and the process can die between any two
statements, so every write here is placed to make the worst crash recoverable
rather than to read well. `expected_children_count` and the umbrella flag go
down before the first child exists, because they are what tells the next tick's
recovery a partial loop from a finished one. Each child's number is then
recorded in the parent BEFORE anything else is done with it, so a crash in that
window costs an orphan child the operator can see rather than a duplicate the
respawned decomposer would create. Seeding the child's own pinned state comes
last for the same reason: it can fail into a park while the parent already
knows the child exists.

The final activation walk runs after the parent's last state write, so a crash
between them cannot leave a runnable child pointing at a parent still labeled
`decomposing`. Its label flips are best-effort -- a child with no recorded
dependencies reads as deps-satisfied on the parent's next `_handle_blocked`
walk, which is the retry.
