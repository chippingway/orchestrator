"""The decomposer session an issue is locked to: taken, resumed, and retired.

A resume has to land on the backend that opened the session -- there is no
bridge between a codex session id and a claude one -- so the agent spec is
pinned on the issue at the first spawn, before the spawn can fail, and read
back from there on every later tick whatever the current `DECOMPOSE_AGENT`
says. That lock is what makes an env flip safe to do while issues are in
flight, and writing it early is what keeps a backend that returned no session
id from leaving the issue unattributed.

A human reply resumes the session with the new comments quoted, and two
callers outside this owner retire it instead. The drift reset does, because a
conversation held against the body the human has since rewritten answers a
question nobody is asking any more. The continuation that lifts a spent-budget
park does too, and there a reply resumes nothing at all: what a trusted
`/orchestrator continue` buys is the fresh spawn the budget refused, so the
conversation that ran out is not the one it pays for.

Both retire through one step, and only the session id. The locked spec must
outlive either reset for the same reason it exists, and the retirement is
separate from the run that follows it because that run cannot do it: a spawn
records an id only where the backend hands one back, so a question or a
timeout that surfaced none would leave the retired conversation resumable.
