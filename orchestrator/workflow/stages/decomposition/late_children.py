"""The children a late split creates, and what each is born knowing.

The initial decomposer's children start from nothing: an issue, a scope, and a
base branch. These start from work that already exists, and everything here is
about handing that work over without handing over the branch it was committed
on -- which is about to be superseded and closed.

**What a child is told.** Its own declared scope, in the words the adjudication
used; the base branch it targets; the snapshot ref and the exact commit under
it; and where it sits in the lineage. Selective reuse is spelled out because
the alternative has to be ruled out in writing: a child may cherry-pick a
coherent commit or copy selected paths, and may not mechanically split hunks to
hit a size target. File and hunk boundaries do not express issue scope, so a
change partitioned along them is one nobody can build or review -- the judgment
about what belongs to a slice stays with the developer who implements it.

**What a child is born with.** The same parent link and creation stamp every
split child gets, plus the ancestry: the lineage this child continues, the
adjudication that created it, and the snapshot it may reuse. That record is
what the child's own size gate reads when it mints a generation, so automatic
splitting stops at the same bound three generations down as it does at the
root, and what its own late prompt states as the declared scope is the slice
written here rather than an issue body somebody has since edited.

**The order children are created in.** The initial mode's crash-safe sequence,
extended by one write: the count and the umbrella flag go down before the first
child exists, and each child's number is recorded in the parent -- in the
children list, in the direct-consumer ledger, and as an obligation of its own
-- in one write, before anything else is done with it. A crash in that window
costs an orphan child an operator can see, never a duplicate the retry would
create, and never a consumer the snapshot's reclamation would fail to wait for.

**Re-entry is a reuse, not a repeat.** A retry walks the same manifest and
adopts every child this GENERATION already records rather than creating a
second one, then re-seeds it: the seed is the one step that can have been lost
after the number was durable, and writing it again costs a read and changes
nothing on a child that already carries it. The child's own state is read and
added to rather than replaced, because by the time a retry runs, a child may
already be implementing.

The register it adopts from is the generation's own `split_children`, not the
stage's shared `children` list, and that distinction is load-bearing. An issue
that was decomposed, saw its children resolve, flipped back to `ready`, and
implemented an oversized candidate still carries the earlier decomposition's
`children` -- so a walk reading that list would adopt COMPLETED issues by
manifest index, reseed them with an ancestry they have nothing to do with, and
activate them. The stage list is written FROM the register instead, which is
also what drops the earlier decomposition's dependency graph rather than
leaving a stale one over the new children.

The one window an ordered register cannot close on its own is the crash
between `create_child_issue` returning and the write recording it: nothing
outside GitHub knows the number yet. So every child is created carrying a
hidden marker naming this ISSUE, this cycle, this generation, and its slice
index, and a walk about to create looks for that marker among the open issues
on the child's own workflow label first. The issue is in there because a cycle
identity is minted per issue and repeats across them -- two parents on their
first candidate are both cycle 1 -- while the lookup walks a label rather than
one parent's children, so without it one parent would adopt another's. The
lookup is taken only where something has to be created, so a fully-adopted
resume pays nothing for it.

its branch is superseded and its pull request is closed, so the snapshot is the
only place to read it from.

- ancestor snapshot ref, on the remote: `{ref}`
- the same snapshot, once fetched here: `{mirror}`
- exact snapshot commit: `{sha}`
- the base it was cut against: `{base_sha}`
- target base branch: `{base_branch}`
- lineage: root #{root}, parent #{parent}, depth {depth} of at most {bound}
- adjudication: cycle {cycle}, generation {generation}

Read it, from this repository:

```sh
git fetch {remote} '+{ref}:{mirror}'       # only if the ref is not here yet
git log --oneline {base_sha}..{sha}
git diff {base_sha}...{sha}                # three dots: what it ADDS
```

Reuse only what your scope covers, and do it one of two ways:

- **cherry-pick a coherent commit** -- `git cherry-pick <commit>` -- when a
  whole commit belongs to your slice; or
- **copy selected paths** -- `git checkout {mirror} -- <path>` -- when it does
  not, and then finish the slice by hand.

Do **not** split hunks mechanically to make the change smaller. File and hunk
boundaries do not express issue scope, and a change partitioned along them is
one nobody can build or review. Where your slice needs part of a file, write
that part; where it needs none of it, leave the file out. Anything the snapshot
does not cover, implement normally.

    The park an unattributed child took goes with the link that attributes it,

    repository's rather than this transaction's -- GitHub sorts by most

    the write that records it -- and a `blocked` issue nobody claims is parked
