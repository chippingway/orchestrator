"""The carriers one decomposition tick hands between its owners.

Each of these exists because the value it carries has to survive a boundary
the call stack alone would lose it across: the worktree policy a run decides
before it can raise, the agent identity a resume is locked to, the children a
split has already created when the next one fails, and the child labels a
parent scan read once and several branches then ask about.
