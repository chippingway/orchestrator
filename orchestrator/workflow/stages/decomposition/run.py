"""One `decomposing` tick: what runs before the agent, and what the agent earns.

Two different questions wear this label, and the first thing a tick does is
ask which one it is. An issue whose record carries a live late generation is
not waiting to be decomposed: its implementation is committed, measured past
the ceiling, and waiting on a verdict, so the whole tick belongs to the late
coordinator and nothing below runs. Everything else is the initial
decomposition this owner has always driven.

An initial decomposition standing on a spent spawn budget is asked next, and
it is asked before the tick has a road to walk down at all: the drift reset,
the kill switch, and the human-reply resume each clear or answer a park that
is not this one, and this one is lifted only by the human its notice asked
for. What holding it costs is nothing, and what it keeps is everything the
issue arrived with.

The order in `_prepare_decomposer_run` is the contract. Drift goes first, so a
body edited during a crash window clears the manifest markers before recovery
can read them and finalize a split the human no longer wants. Recovery goes
next, and deliberately ahead of the `DECOMPOSE` kill switch: children already
open on GitHub have to be resolved whether or not new decompositions are still
enabled -- a kill switch that stranded existing work would be the wrong kind of
off. Only past both does the tick pick between resuming a parked session and
spawning a fresh one.

Everything after the run is about what that run is allowed to publish. A
`paused` label applied mid-run wins over the whole disposition, an agent that
left commits or edits in a read-only worktree parks with the worktree kept for
inspection, and an interrupted run is dropped entirely -- checked in that order
so a killed run's changes stay inspectable rather than being discarded as
untrustworthy.

The worktree is torn down by an `ExitStack` callback rather than at each exit,
because `keep_worktree` is decided in the middle of that sequence and every
path after it -- including one that raises -- has to honor the decision.

    Asked before anything else this handler does, and asked of every tick

    refused comment stranded, an owner read that could not be taken -- and

    generation to read them off, and the call comes straight back saying so.

    adjudication" falls through, so an oversized committed candidate is never
    handed to the agent that would re-decompose the issue from scratch -- and
    the read-only scratch checkout that agent needs is never created for a run
