"""What a decomposed parent reads off its children before it acts on them.

The scan is one fresh read of every recorded child's issue and workflow label.
It can be a fresh read because the dispatcher serializes `decomposing`,
`blocked`, and `umbrella` into a single bucket on one worker thread, so a
child's own label flip cannot land between this read and the writes that follow
it. A read that raises abandons the whole tick for this parent rather than
acting on a partial picture -- the next poll retries.

Two child states end the parent's tick instead of advancing it, and both park
idempotently so they do not re-comment every tick. A `rejected` child is a
human decision the parent cannot interpret. A child closed without a terminal
label is invisible to the closed-issue sweep, so its label is frozen wherever
it was at close and the parent would otherwise wait on it forever -- except
when the close was an external merge, which is why each candidate is retried
against the PR-merge finalize before it counts as manually closed.

A parent also re-checks the human's requirements here. Its own body may have
been edited while children were running, and unlike an implementing issue there
is no later stage to notice; the reroute back to `decomposing` re-derives the
manifest against what the body says now.
