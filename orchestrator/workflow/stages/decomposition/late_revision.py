"""The developer run a human's guidance earns, and the prompt it runs under.

Guidance about an oversized candidate is not a decomposition question, so it
does not go to the late decomposer. The work itself has to change, and the
session that wrote it is the one that knows what it wrote -- so the ORIGINAL
developer session is resumed, with the human's comments quoted, in the
worktree the candidate already lives in. It runs under `agent_role=developer`
and `stage=decomposing`, because that is what it is and where it happened: the
issue never leaves `workflow:decomposing`, and an analytics row that claimed
otherwise would put a developer run in a stage the issue was not in.

The budgets are the ones that already exist. The resume budget and the
session rotation behind it belong to the shared developer resume, which this
goes through rather than around; the per-issue daily retry cap counts fresh
spawns, and a resume driven by a human's reply is an unblock signal rather
than a retry, exactly as it is in every other stage that resumes on one.

The prompt is this owner's own, and one line of it is a contract with the
reconciliation: it asks for the same `ACK:` marker every other drift resume
asks for, because an unchanged commit needs one before it may be re-measured
as an answer. What the marker is read against, and what a commit nobody
vouched for earns instead, are decided where the checkout is.

Nothing before that reconciliation is durable. The guidance is consumed, the
park is cleared, and the session is recorded in memory; the write that keeps
any of it is the one the reconciliation itself makes. A mid-run pause and a
shutdown sweep therefore leave the issue exactly as the prior tick did, with
the human's guidance still unread -- which costs one repeated developer run
and never a dropped instruction.

Two owners carry the halves this one asks for rather than performs.
`late_revision_obligations` decides whether the committed candidate may be
replaced at all, and it is asked first on both roads in, ahead of the notice
and the spawn; `late_revision_reconciliation` proves the tree, re-freezes
whatever commit the checkout ends on, and measures it again. Both are reached
from here and neither reaches back, so the two entry points below -- the
guidance that buys a developer run, and the reply to a revision that stalled
-- are the whole of what the stage calls.

    The guidance is consumed in memory before the run, so the comments quoted
    into the prompt and the ones the watermark covers are the same set, and it
    becomes durable only on a path that reconciles what the run left. That is
    the same order every stage that resumes on a human reply keeps: a mid-run
    pause and a shutdown sweep both mean this tick did not happen, and a
    consumption made durable by one of them would drop a human's instruction
    on the floor with nothing left on the issue pointing at it. The cost is
    the one every declined run has -- the next tick resumes the developer
    again on the same reply, and it sees its own prior commit.

    The park this answers goes the same way. Clearing it is staged here so a
    run that then fails re-parks with the reason it actually failed for rather
    than leaving the issue claiming it is still waiting to be told what the
    edit meant.

    A close a poll observed stops it before the agent and again after, and
    the "before" is asked twice: the resume is the same kind of step a spawn
    is -- an agent on somebody's repository, paid for and free to decide --
    and the notice this call posts ahead of it is a request the poll runs
    beside. So the reading is taken as the tick is entered, again right
    against the resume, and once more when the run comes back, because no one
    of the three covers the other two: the first two stop the agent, and the
    last stops the remeasure that would write a fresh candidate over a cycle
    a close already ended.
