"""What a guarded split does, in the one order every crash in it is safe in.

Snapshot, children, links, supersession, activation, cleanup -- and the order
is the contract, because each step is an effect on GitHub or on a remote that
the process can die immediately after. Every one of them is preceded by the
durable fact that lets the next tick tell "already done" from "never started",
and every one of them is idempotent when that fact turns out to be ambiguous.

**Snapshot first, before any child.** A split ends with the parent's branch
superseded and its pull request closed, so the committed work survives only as
the ref `late_snapshot` creates and proves. A child created ahead of that ref
would be pointed at a branch that is about to stop existing.

**Then the children, each recorded before anything is done with it.** The
umbrella flag and the expected count go down before the first one, and every
child lands in the children list, the direct-consumer ledger, and the
obligation ledger in a single write. That write is what makes the snapshot's
reclamation wait for it, which is why it has to be durable before the child can
run.

**Then the links, and only then the supersession.** The parent says what it
became and where its children are; the pull request its work is on says it is
superseded, names the umbrella, the children, the snapshot ref, and the exact
commit, and is closed. Neither can be undone, and both are idempotent -- the
parent's announcement is gated on the durable stamp beside it, and the pull
request's is gated on its own hidden marker on the thread, so a crash between a
post and the write recording it costs at most a repeat that never happens
twice.

**And the owner between every one of them.** A close is not something this run
is told about: a poll that observes one while this worker holds the issue can
hand it to nobody, so the issue is re-read before each step the remote keeps --
before each child, before the announcement, before the supersession, and before
the retirement that hands the parent to `umbrella` and lets its children run.
What a close ends is the CYCLE rather than the tick, and where it lands is what
the cancellation reads back: an ending entered at the supersession still owns
the held pull request, and one entered just past it takes on the superseded
branch the retirement never got to write down.

**And the publication between every one of them too, on the road that has
one.** The owner is not the only thing a human moves mid-pass: the pull
request the close is made on can be merged, reopened, or pushed to, and every
step of the tail is licensed by that close being on it. So it is asked on the
same rule and at the same barriers -- in front of the close, in front of the
retirement, in front of EVERY child released, and immediately in front of the
branch delete. No step is ever run on evidence a step before it took, and
"before it" includes the reading a step of its own spent: the child scan a
release is decided on is a request per child, and the probe the reclamation
may spend on an ordered ref is another, so the last two barriers live inside
the walk and inside the reclamation rather than in front of either.

The one in front of the close is why the close is made against a second
reading rather than the first: the receipt the first carries costs a comment
listing, which is a round-trip standing between the state and head read beside
it and the write those two license. Asked again with no listing behind them,
they are the last thing to reach GitHub before the write -- so a change a
human settled or somebody pushed to inside that window is left untouched,
rather than marked and closed and only then refused.

What a refusal costs depends on which side of the retirement it lands. Before
it the pass parks: the record is live, so the issue stays on `decomposing`
with the children blocked and the branch intact, and the next tick supersedes
the same pull request again. Past it there is no live adjudication left to
park, so the last two barriers decline the step in front of them and leave it
to the retry that owns it: the umbrella's own walk for the children, its
terminal for the branch. Which is why the pre-retirement barrier is placed as
the very last thing before that write, with the branch resolved ahead of it
rather than between.

Those two retries ask the same question themselves, and that is what makes
declining a step safe rather than a one-tick delay. The retirement keeps the
publication group on purpose -- it is the only thing left on the issue naming
which pull request this split closed -- so the shared activation walk re-asks
it in front of every relabel it makes and `late_cleanup` re-asks it in front
of every branch it deletes, on this pass and on every umbrella tick after it.
Dropped there, a change reopened afterwards would have its work handed to
children on the very next poll and the ref it points at reaped by the
terminal.

**Then the label, the retirement, and the activation, in that order.** The
generation is retired -- identity, commits, both ledgers, and the publication
group kept, the measurement dropped -- in the same write that hands the issue
to `umbrella`,
because a live generation pins `workflow:decomposing` and the relabel guard
would put an early flip straight back. Activation runs after that write for the
reason the initial split's does: a crash between them must not leave a runnable
child under a parent still labelled `decomposing`. And the owner is read once
more between the two, since the write itself is a request a close can land
inside -- that last read is taken without a claim, because the retirement has
already moved the record to `cleaning_up` and a claim would name `owner_check`
over the boundary the whole-ledger rule reads.

**Cleanup last, and never in the way.** The superseded branch is an obligation
recorded on the ledger and reconciled after the children are running: a delete
that fails leaves a `failed` entry to retry and does not hold a single child
back, while the umbrella's own terminal completion is what it does block. That
asymmetry is the point -- children waiting on a branch deletion would be work
stalled on tidiness, whereas an umbrella closing over an unreclaimed remote
would be an obligation nobody ever settles.

Every failure is a park with the recorded verdict left standing, so the retry
costs a GitHub read rather than an agent: the next eligible tick reuses the
same recorded split, re-enters here, adopts everything already durable, and
carries on from the first step that did not land.

    that creates a generation, so the cap is enforced where the children would

    The measurement is what goes. A parent that has become an umbrella has no
    candidate to measure -- the work is its children's now -- and keeping the
    reading would leave the record answering "oversized", which is the one
    thing that pins `workflow:decomposing` and would put the umbrella label
    back on every tick.

    Everything a later reader still needs stays. The identity is what a
    cleanup record is correlated by, the commits are what the snapshot
    preserves, and both ledgers are what the remote is still owed -- including
    the branch this write is recording as owed for the first time. The ordered
    child register stays with them: it is what says which child owns which
    slice of the manifest, and a transaction re-entered against a retired
    generation has to adopt them rather than open a second set.

    And the publication group stays, which is the one part of this that is
    about a question rather than an obligation. Everything the supersession
    licenses is not finished when this write lands: children are still to be
    released and a branch is still to be deleted, and both run on later ticks
    under `umbrella`, where nothing else on the issue could say which pull
    request this split closed or what head it closed over. Dropping the group
    here would leave those two steps with nothing to re-ask, so a change
    somebody reopened afterwards would have its branch deleted under it and
    its work handed to children anyway. It costs no live adjudication: what
    pins `workflow:decomposing` is the measurement, and that is what goes.
