"""The pull request a post-publication verdict was taken over, read once.

Both roads out of an adjudication entered on the published side have to ask
the same question before they act, and neither can look it up: the entry the
gate froze names the pull request the work is already on and the head it was
standing on, so what a settlement or a split owes is a PROOF that those two
are still what they were rather than a search. A `single` publishes onto that
pull request; a `split` closes it over a supersession and hands the work to
children. Both are irreversible on the remote, and both are wrong if somebody
moved or settled the publication while the adjudication was open.

So the reading lives here rather than on either of them. It is one owner
because it is one fact -- the state and the head of one pull request -- and
because a fetched pull request is LAZY: `get_pr` asks GitHub nothing, and the
requests that can fail are the attribute reads behind it. A caller guarding
only the lookup leaves those two to raise out of a road whose every other
refusal parks, and an exception on the way to a park is a park nobody takes.

The pull request those facts were read off travels back with them, so a caller
that has to ACT may act on the object it proved rather than on a second
lookup. A human can merge, push to, or reopen one between two round-trips, and
a proof spent on the first says nothing about what the second returns -- so
the window a caller cannot close is the write itself, never the fetch in front
of it.

The question a SETTLED split then keeps asking lives here too, and for the
same reason the reading does: it is one fact about one pull request, and three
owners need it. The transaction asks it in front of every step its own
supersession licenses; the activation walk asks it before every child it
releases; the reclamation asks it immediately before deleting the branch that
pull request points at. None of them may share an answer with the step in
front of it, so what is published is the ASK rather than a fact -- taken from
the record each time, which is why the split's retirement keeps the
publication group rather than dropping it with the measurement.

    step run on evidence a human had time to overtake. The record can carry it

    "" for everything that never had one -- an umbrella the initial decomposer
    made, a split entered before publication, a damaged group -- and no

    Three readings, and each is a different thing for a human to reconcile. An
    OPEN one was reopened behind the close, and releasing children or deleting
    the branch beside it is the outcome this whole road exists to prevent. A
    MERGED one is a human deciding the opposite of what the supersession
    claims. And a head that moved is the same refusal the close itself is
    proved against: what the snapshot holds is the frozen commit rather than
    whatever was pushed onto the branch since.

    A reading nothing could take is a refusal like any other and reads as one
    here: what the callers do with it is decline the step in front of them,
    which is the same answer they give a publication that really did move.

    No receipt is asked for, so no comment listing is paid for. What these
    callers need is the STATE -- closed, and closed over the head the verdict
    was taken on -- and the close being there has already answered the rest.
