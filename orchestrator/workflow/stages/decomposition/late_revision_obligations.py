"""What the adjudication before this one already did outside this process.

Asked once, ahead of the notice and ahead of the spawn, because a revision
ends in a NEW candidate under a new generation and everything that generation
decides is decided about work the old one may already have handed to something
this process does not own. Two effects put a candidate past the point of
replacement, and both are read off the record rather than guessed.

**Children.** They exist as real GitHub issues, carry an ancestry naming the
adjudication that made them, and are recorded as the consumers a snapshot is
retained for -- so a second manifest over the top of them would strand every
one: nothing polls a child the parent no longer records, and no automatic rule
can say which of two manifests a human meant.

**A snapshot obligation.** The ref is named for the generation but the commit
under it is the candidate that generation froze, and the reclamation proves a
ref is ours to delete by comparing the two. A revision moves `candidate_sha`
and leaves the entry pointing at a ref that no longer matches it, so the
reclamation reads a mismatch and refuses -- forever, holding the umbrella's
terminal open over a ref nothing can settle. The entry is refused in every
state it can be in, because none of them proves the ref is absent: `pending`
is a push that may have landed, and `failed` is a create that may have landed
and a verification that did not.

So the issue is handed back instead. What the human asked for is not lost --
their comment stands, whatever the split created stands, and the recorded
verdict stands -- and settling it is a decision about things that already
exist, which is theirs to make.

The hand-back is the reconciliation owner's own park rather than one written
here. A refusal is a late exit like every other: it stages the same reason,
completes on the same record, and rides out past the same fresh owner read --
so the issue learns about it on exactly the terms a reconciliation that failed
would have used.
