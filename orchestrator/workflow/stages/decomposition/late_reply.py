"""One fenced block at the end of a LATE reply, or a reason it is not one.

An additive mode beside the initial parser, on its own fence and with its own
decision vocabulary, so that what a missing or malformed initial manifest
means is exactly what it always meant. The two fences cannot be mistaken for
each other -- `orchestrator-manifest` is not a substring of
`orchestrator-late-manifest` and the patterns are anchored on the whole name
-- so an initial reply cannot be read as a late one or the other way round.

The envelope is the same and is asked once, on the owner beside this one: one
block, and nothing after it. What differs is what a reply with NO block means.
The initial contract treats it as the decomposer asking a question, because
there its question has nowhere else to go; the late contract gives a question
its own structured decision, complete with the category telemetry counts, so a
reply with no block is a protocol failure and is parked for a human rather
than read as an answer.

`split` is validated by the initial mode's own split validator rather than by
a second copy of it. The child cap, the shape of a child, and the acyclicity
of the graph they declare are properties of a manifest that is about to become
GitHub issues, and that is the same manifest either mode produces -- so a rule
tightened there tightens here, and the number the late prompt states is still
the number the reply is judged against.

`single` carries one field the other two do not: the explanation of what
stopped a split. The verdict says the committed work is one change AND that no
safe split of it is available, and it decides nothing on its own -- it hands an
oversized candidate to a human -- so that reason is the whole of what the human
is given to decide on. It is read off the reply as text rather than left in the
prose around the block, which nothing keeps, and a fresh reply that declares
the outcome without it is refused rather than recorded: what would be kept
otherwise is a verdict missing the one thing it exists to carry, and the park a
refusal takes names the field that was owed.

What that refusal is NOT is a rule about records. A result recorded before this
domain kept an explanation is on live issues, and it reads back as this
candidate's answer with a stand-in beside it -- re-adjudicating to recover
prose would buy a second run free to decide something else entirely. The
obligation is the fresh reply's alone, exactly as the per-child budget below
is.

Every child of a `split` owes one field the initial mode never asks for: the
lines that child is estimated to ADD across all of its paths. It is required
and it is bounded -- a real count of at least one line, strictly below the
ceiling this candidate was measured against -- because a split whose children
are each still oversized is not a split, and the cheapest place to catch one
that says so is while it is still a reply rather than after it has become
issues. What is judged here is whether the proposal is ACTIONABLE, and never
whether a later measurement may disagree with it: what decides that a child is
oversized is the cumulative measurement of that child's own diff. The number
itself travels past this owner -- the record keeps it and the child issue
states it -- so the slice a developer is handed says what it was sized at.

The ceiling comes from the generation the reply is about rather than from
configuration, so an answer is judged against the number its own prompt
stated even where an operator retuned the knob while the agent was running. A
generation that cannot say what its ceiling was refuses nothing on size, and
still refuses a child that declared no estimate at all: a missing budget is a
protocol failure whatever the bound is, while a bound nobody can name is not
one a reply can be measured against.

That rule sits on THIS owner rather than on the shared split validator, for
the reason the explanation above is asked only of a reply: it is a rule about
what an agent just said. The same validator reads recorded manifests back off
the pinned comment, and a live issue's recorded split was written before any
budget was asked for -- so a requirement placed there would read every one of
them as no manifest at all and send a candidate that has already been
adjudicated round again.

What this owner does NOT decide is whether a `split` is allowed at all. The
lineage bound is the record's invariant and is enforced where the generation
is: a structurally perfect split proposed at the bound parses cleanly here and
is refused one layer up, which is what keeps "the agent got the format wrong"
apart from "the agent proposed something the lineage forbids".
