"""The dep-graph walk that decides which children may start next.

A `blocked` child becomes `ready` the moment every dependency the manifest
recorded for it is `done`. A child with no recorded dependencies satisfies that
vacuously, which is deliberate: it is also the retry for a no-dep child whose
same-tick activation flip failed at split time, so nothing has to remember that
the flip was missed.

A child GitHub reports as closed is passed over, whatever label it wears.
Closing an issue does not change its label, so a child a human ended while it
was still `blocked` sits there looking startable forever -- and a walk that
started it would relabel a closed issue `ready`, overriding the close and
handing the umbrella a child that will never report. It is skipped rather than
held, because nothing is going to release it.

A parent whose children a late split handed over is asked one more thing, at
exactly the same place and for exactly the same reason: those children start
on the strength of the pull request their work was superseded on still being
closed, and that can stop being true between one relabel and the next. A walk
that asked once -- or that let its caller ask, one scan of the children
earlier -- would release its second child on evidence taken before its first.
So it is asked off this parent's own record, immediately in front of every
relabel, and a refusal latches: a licence that has lapsed does not come back
inside one walk. A parent that never entered the size gate carries no such
record and answers without a request.

That ask is itself a request, so the latch is taken on both sides of it: once
in front, where it costs nothing to refuse early, and once behind, where a
close a poll observed during the lookup would otherwise reach nothing before
the relabel lands.

Held children are logged rather than parked, because the tree is still making
progress: their siblings run concurrently and are what will eventually release
them. The line names the exact unfinished dependencies so an operator reading a
tick log can tell a waiting parent from a stuck one without opening GitHub, and
it is emitted only when something is actually held so a healthy parent stays
quiet.
