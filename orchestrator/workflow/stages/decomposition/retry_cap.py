"""The spent-budget park an initial decomposition meets, and what lifts it.

A `decomposing` tick has three roads that would walk straight past a park, and
each of them is right for the park it was written against. The drift reset
wipes the manifest and clears the flags on a body edit, because an issue whose
requirements moved has to be re-planned against the new ones. The kill switch
clears the same flags and hands the issue to implementation, because an issue
nobody is decomposing any more belongs there. The awaiting-human resume reads
any trusted reply as the answer the issue was stopped for, because that is
what an agent's question is waiting on.

None of the three is an answer to THIS park. What its notice asked for is a
human deciding to spend more of this issue's day on it, and an edited body, a
setting an operator changed, and "any update?" are none of them -- so the park
is asked ahead of all three, and while it stands the tick ends here. Nothing
is spawned and nothing is written, which is what leaves the manifest, the
children already open on GitHub, the locked decomposer session and its spec,
the recorded pull request, and a late generation's whole record exactly as the
park found them. The refusal is still recorded, because a park nobody can see
going on refusing is one an operator reads as a workflow that stopped for no
reason.

The one thing that lifts it is a trusted `/orchestrator continue`: the renewal
the notice itself asks for, and the only reading of a thread that means "spend
another attempt here". The command is taken with whatever else the comment
carries -- a decision that arrives with an explanation is still the decision,
and the explanation reaches the fresh decomposer through the prompt's own
comment context -- while an untrusted account's copy of it buys nothing, since
what it would buy is agent time on somebody else's word.

What one command buys is one attempt. `_grant_continuation` clears the park
and writes the grant down, and the tick falls through to the ordinary fresh
spawn, which spends it at the same gate that refused the last one. The grant
is durable before the spawn and the spend is not: a tick that dies -- or a run
a pause or a shutdown declines -- between the two leaves the attempt where the
human put it, unspent.

    a human has just bought it another attempt -- and on that second answer

    so while the obligation stands, a command on the thread is a command
    written before the question was asked. The replay leaves the obligation
    standing for exactly one reason, an unreadable thread, and a second read
    taken here is as likely to succeed as the first was to fail: read clean,
    it would buy an attempt with words nobody wrote in reply and clear the
    notice they were owed on the way out. So the sentence goes first, and the
