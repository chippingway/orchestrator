"""The spent-budget park a late adjudication meets, and what lifts it.

A late adjudication spends the same per-issue day of tokens every other agent
run does, so the gate in front of its fresh spawn is the shared one on
`workflow/engine/retry_budget.py`. What is here is the half that gate
deliberately does not own: the park a refusal takes, the sentence it owes the
thread, and the one reply that buys another attempt.

The park is staged through this mode's own outcome owner rather than through
the shared parking form beside the gate. That is not a preference: everything
a late tick holds is durable state under a live generation -- the frozen pair,
the phase the record reached, the hold standing on the pull request the
candidate is on, the locked run and whatever verdict it recorded -- and the
shared form writes pinned state itself, on its own schedule, with none of that
in hand. Staged here, the park rides the write the generation rides, and what
the thread is owed rides it too (`late_park_notice`), which is what gives this
refusal the same persist-before-effect delivery, failed-delivery retry, and
post-crash reconciliation every other late park has.

Nothing supersedes it. The parks a late attempt retires are the ones a retry
answers -- a hold that failed is reconciled again, a worktree that was gone is
back -- and a budget nobody has renewed is answered by neither. So the park is
asked at the top of the adjudication, ahead of the evidence probe, the hold,
and the content settlement, and while it stands the tick ends there having
written nothing, spawned nothing, and said nothing. What that keeps is
everything the issue arrived with: the generation and its frozen candidate,
the pull request still wearing the adjudication notice, the pinned run, the
recorded result, and the fingerprints the next content read is measured
against.

The one thing that lifts it is a trusted `/orchestrator continue`: the renewal
the notice itself asks for, and the only reading of a thread that means "spend
another attempt on this candidate". An edited body is not one -- drift is a
question about the requirements, and this park is a question about the
budget -- nor is "any update?", nor is an untrusted account's copy of the
command, since what it would buy is agent time on somebody else's word.

What one command buys is one attempt. The grant is durable before the spawn
and the spend is not, so a tick that dies -- or a run a mid-run `paused` or a
shutdown declines -- leaves the attempt where the human put it, unspent.

    True is the whole tick: the caller returns having neither proved the
    frozen pair, reconciled the hold on the pull request, read what the
    humans have said since the candidate was frozen, nor reused a recorded
    answer. False means either that this issue is not parked on its budget at
    all, or that a human has just bought it another attempt -- and on that
    second answer the grant is already durable, so the spawn below spends
    something the next tick would find again if this one dies before reaching
    it.

    What runs AHEAD of this question is what is owed whether or not a park
    stands: the reconciliation of a notice already on the thread, the owner
    read the generation still records, and the redelivery of a sentence a
    refused comment stranded. The last of those is what says what THIS park is
    for, which is why the park is not asked before it.

    A park that still owes the thread its sentence is held before anything on
    that thread is read as an answer. Saying the sentence moves the response
    boundary past everything written under the old one, so while the
    obligation stands a command is one written before the question was asked.
    The redelivery leaves it standing for exactly one reason, a thread nobody
    could read, and a second read taken here is as likely to succeed as the
    first was to fail: read clean, it would buy an attempt with words nobody
    wrote in reply and consume the notice they were owed on the way out.

    The refusal is recorded either way, because a park nobody can see going on
    refusing is one an operator reads as an adjudication that stopped for no
    reason.
