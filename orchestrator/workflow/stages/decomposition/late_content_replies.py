"""Which of a human's fresh replies is a requirement, and which is a control.

The classification half of the late content read. `late_content` decides who
is counted and what a fingerprint is taken over -- the trust filter, the two
floors a reply has to clear, the ratcheting watermark, the digests -- and this
owner reads the comments that survive all of that, one at a time. They are
split because they are answerable from different things: the reading above is
about the thread and is held to a trust policy and a watermark, while this one
is about a single body and is held to the command vocabulary the whole
workflow shares.

Nothing is parsed here. Both controls are recognized by `engine/messages`,
asked through it rather than re-read, so what `/orchestrator continue` and
`/orchestrator authorize-oversized <commit>` MEAN is spelled in one place and
a late reading cannot drift from the gate that acts on them.

Only the WHOLE comment is either command, which is the same rule read in both
directions. Prose around the authorization is prose -- that is what keeps a
paragraph mentioning the command from becoming a bypass of the size gate --
and the same paragraph is still guidance, because a human who wrote a
sentence about a command wrote a sentence to act on.

What this owner does NOT decide is whether a comment counts toward a digest.
Both controls are trusted comments on the thread, so their bodies are
fingerprinted beside everyone else's by the owner above; being no requirement
is a statement about what an agent may be handed, not about what an edit after
the fact is allowed to hide.
