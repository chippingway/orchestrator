"""What a split still owes a remote, and the one boundary that can settle it.

A split leaves two things behind: the branch its superseded candidate was
committed on, and the immutable ref that candidate was preserved under. Neither
is a precondition for the children -- children held back until a remote delete
succeeded would be work stalled on housekeeping -- so the transaction records
both and lets the children run whatever the first attempt said.

What that costs is an obligation nobody would otherwise come back to, because
the issue is an umbrella by then and an umbrella polls its children and nothing
else. So this owner is asked at the boundary where an unsettled obligation
still matters and where the condition to settle it has just become true: the
umbrella's all-children-resolved branch. The narrow closed-owner sweep beside
it asks the same question of an issue a human closed mid-cycle, which is the
one other way a live ledger stops being visited -- same rules, same ledger.
That issue's own terminal belongs to the cancellation owner the sweep reaches
these rules through; nothing here decides one.

**The branch is unconditional.** It is superseded the moment the split lands,
so every visit retries whatever is not yet reconciled -- and "the branch" is
every surface it exists on: the remote ref, the local ref, and the checkout
holding it. A remote delete that succeeded beside a worktree that would not
come down is not a settled obligation, because what is left behind is a
checkout the per-tick base refresh goes on merging into. So the entry reads
`reconciled` only once all three are provably gone, and the proof is a read
rather than an exit code: `git worktree remove` and `git branch -D` are
best-effort by design, and a caller that has to RECORD the teardown asks
afterwards instead of trusting them.

**Only this issue's own targets are deleted.** Both come off a ledger a human
can edit and both are spent on destructive calls, so each is matched against
what this issue's own record would name -- exactly, not by shape. A branch has
to BE one of the two names this spec publishes this issue under, because
`orchestrator/<anything>/issue-41` is also another repository's branch for its
own issue 41 and two specs sharing a `target_root` is the ordinary case; a
snapshot ref has to BE the one the namespace mints for this issue, cycle, and
generation, because every generation in a lineage names the same commit and so
namespace-and-SHA is not identity. The issue number is taken from the issue
being walked rather than from the record, so a hand-edited identity cannot aim
either delete. A target that does not match is recorded `failed` and holds the
terminal open for a human, which is the one answer that neither deletes
somebody else's work nor quietly forgets the obligation.

**Except while the change it was superseded under is back.** A branch is taken
away from a pull request a split closed, so a human who reopened that change
has one pointing at a ref this pass would remove out from under them -- and
that is the one answer here no later visit could put back. What still names
the pull request is the record: the split's retirement keeps the publication
group for exactly this. Nothing is attempted and nothing is recorded `failed`,
since no delete went out; the entry stays owed, which holds the terminal, and
the log line beside it is what says why.

Asked immediately in front of the delete rather than while the work list is
built, and the difference is a request: the snapshot rule below may spend a
read-only probe deciding whether an ordered ref is already gone, and a human
can reopen a pull request inside it. An answer good enough to build a list
with is not one good enough to delete on.

**The snapshot is not.** A ref may be deleted only once every recorded direct
consumer has ENDED, and all-children-resolved is exactly when that becomes
true for the consumers this split created. Ended is read off the consumer's
own state rather than its label, on a scan taken by the visit that acts on it
-- the umbrella hands over the one it already took, the sweep takes its own.
All three dispositions that end a consumer close the issue and none of them
survives a reopen, while a label does: a child reopened while still wearing
`done` is live again, and a reading taken off the label would delete the only
copy of the work it came back for. Anything that cannot be proved -- a
consumer missing from the scan, one whose read failed, a consumer ledger this
binary could not type -- keeps the ref.

All of which is about the consumers the ledger NAMES, so the prior question is
whether it names all of them, and the record's own phase is what answers it. A
child is created and then recorded in two writes -- it must be, since a child
on GitHub the parent does not record is a child nothing would come back to --
so while `splitting` stands the list may be short by one that already exists,
and how long the list is decides nothing: a set of ended consumers says as
little about the child it has not reached as an empty one does. Nothing on the
ref is reclaimed in that window. Either side of it the list is whole -- before
the split nothing has been created, and past it the loop ran to the end -- and
that is also what makes an EMPTY list a fact rather than a gap: the ref is
retained ahead of the first child, so an owner closed in that interval has no
consumers because there are none. A cancelled cycle answers with the boundary
it kept rather than with `cancelling`, which is a boundary of its own and
would say nothing about the loop.

**A reclamation is decided once, then retried until it lands.** The proof
above is a reading of live issues and cannot be reproduced, so the entry is
written `reclaiming` before the delete, the consumers are read once more past
that write, and a later visit acts on the RECORD rather than on a proof it
cannot repeat -- for one thing only, and only for a ref the remote no longer
has. What follows the delete is each child being told, in one comment and
nothing else: this owner may not write a consumer's pinned state at all, so
what a child does about it is the child's own to decide on its own dispatch
(`late_reuse`). The telling runs ahead of the entry that records the delete,
so a tick that dies in between repeats it -- harmlessly, since a child already
holding this reclamation's receipt is skipped.

A CANCELLED cycle tells none of them and reconciles on the delete alone. The
receipt is what a live split owes children it is still driving; an ending a
human's close forced drives none of them, and leaves each exactly as it found
it. What the child would have read the receipt FOR still reaches it: the
transport drops this host's copy of the ref before it touches the remote and
refuses the reclamation outright if that copy cannot be proved gone, so a
child reopened afterwards asks the remote once and its own guard stops it.

**And the terminal is held by one thing the ledger cannot hold it by.** A
split entered past publication owes an answer as well as its obligations:
whether the pull request it closed is still closed. The two can disagree
exactly where it matters -- a reclamation that FINISHED leaves nothing owed,
so a human who restores the branch and reopens the change afterwards finds
every entry settled and the terminal free. What that terminal writes is `done`
and a close, and the write ahead of it drops the publication group, so nothing
would ask again and an open change carrying superseded work would be left
under a parent this workflow had declared finished. The answer is not written
back to the ledger: nothing IS owed the remote there, and an entry claiming
otherwise would send a later pass to delete a branch a human put back on
purpose.

**Nothing that cannot be proved settled lets a terminal fire.** An obligation
ledger this binary could not fully type blocks outright: the entries it could
not read are still obligations, and reclaiming around them would close an
umbrella over whatever they name. So does a ledger holding anything at all on
a record whose cycle identity is damaged -- there is nothing to correlate a
reclamation to, and no issue number to prove a branch belongs to this
generation, so the only safe answer is to say so loudly and stay open.

**Every state except `reconciled` is owed, for a ref exactly as for a branch.**
There is no reading under which an object still on the remote is settled: a ref
kept because a consumer could not be proved ended is one this repository is
holding, and an umbrella closed over it is an object nothing would ever come
back for, because the parent is `done` by then and no pass revisits it. So the
label staying put IS the retry, and the reason it is held is logged on every
tick that holds -- a terminal that will not fire and never says why is the one
shape an operator cannot act on.

The ledger takes any state the vocabulary defines from any writer, which is why
the reading is "not reconciled" rather than a list of the states this binary
writes: a state read as neither owed nor settled would be an object left on the
remote by an umbrella that closed saying it owed nothing.

Idempotent by construction, for the reason the transport underneath is: both
deletes treat an absent target as success, so a retry after a crash between the
call and the write that recorded it costs one request and reports the same
answer.

    child nothing would come back to -- so while `splitting` stands the list
    may be short by one that already exists, and a list of ended consumers
    proves nothing about the child it has not reached. That window is where a
    partial ledger would otherwise authorize the delete, unread and untold.
    Either side of it the list is whole: nothing has been created yet, or the
    loop ran to the end and the transaction moved on.

    It is also what makes an EMPTY ledger a fact rather than a gap, which is
    what left a ref nothing would ever reclaim: the snapshot is retained
    before the first child exists, so an owner a human closed in that interval
    has no consumers because there are none, and `all(())` settles it.

    A loop the RECORD proves finished is whole at any boundary, which is
    asked before the phase is consulted at all -- see `_every_child_recorded`.
    Two writers make that necessary and neither is a bug: `splitting` is
    written before the first create and again beside every child recorded, so
    the phase alone cannot say which end of the loop a record sits at; and a
    retried transaction rewrites `snapshotting` over whatever it reached, so a
    finished split can come back wearing the boundary it started from.

    A boundary before the loop is believed only as far as the record bears it
    out -- see `_split_began`. A pinned comment written by a binary that
    rewound its own phase is exactly what that reading is for: the guard on
    the record stops new rewinds and migrates nothing, so what has to answer
    for one already in flight is evidence no phase write ever touched. Past
    the loop the phase needs no corroboration: the transaction reaches
    `superseding` only once every child is created and recorded.

    A SEALED ledger answers ahead of all of it. The count can only ever be
    reached by a loop that ran to the end of its manifest, and a cancelled one
    never will: the children it did not make are ones nothing is going to
    make. So the loop that stopped writes down that its register is final --
    which it only does where every child that exists is already on it -- and
    that is a stronger reading than the count, not a weaker one.

    Believed only for the cycle it NAMES. The seal is a decomposition key
    rather than a late one, so no write that ends a generation drops it, and
    a later cycle on the same issue reads a seal its own split never wrote. A
    partial register would then look final, and the delete below would take
    the ref that cycle's unrecorded children were cut from.

    can reopen one at any moment. So the entry is written `reclaiming` BEFORE
    the delete, which is what stops a tick that died after the push from
    leaving a ref the ledger says is retained and the remote does not have.

    the consumers are read again ahead of every delete, and only a ref the

    happened, and a consumer that came back to it is answered by the receipt
    and the child's own guard.

    **The delete is named against the commit this generation preserved**, so a
    ref somebody re-pointed is refused rather than reclaimed, and an absent
    one is a success -- which is what makes the retry cost one read.

    **The children are told before the entry is closed.** A child that reads
    its ancestry after this owner has gone quiet would otherwise follow a
    pointer to nothing, so each is sent one comment saying the ref is gone and
    what continuing takes. It runs behind a delete the remote accepted and
    ahead of the record of it, so a tick that dies in between re-enters
    through `reclaiming` and repeats it; a child already holding this
    reclamation's receipt is skipped, which is what keeps the sentence to one.
    Nothing here touches a consumer's pinned state -- what acts on the receipt
    is the child's own guard, on the child's own dispatch.

    Refused outright unless the target IS this generation's ref. The transport
    proves the namespace and the commit, and neither is identity: every
    generation of every issue in a lineage cut from the same candidate names
    the same SHA, so a hand-edited entry naming a sibling's ref would pass
