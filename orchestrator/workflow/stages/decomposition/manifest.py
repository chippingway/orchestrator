"""One fenced block at the end of a decomposer reply, or a reason it is not one.

The decompose prompt promises exactly one `orchestrator-manifest` fence and
nothing after it, and this is where that promise is held to. The three answers
callers branch on are deliberate: a manifest, a manifest-shaped payload with a
reason it was rejected, and no fence at all. Only the middle one is the agent
getting it wrong; the last one is the agent asking a question, and the stage
parks those differently.

Both envelope rules exist because a decomposer message is prose around the
block. Taking the FIRST fence would let a manifest quoted from the prompt --
or from an earlier draft the agent talked itself out of -- override the answer
it actually settled on, so more than one fence is an error rather than a
choice; and content after the closing fence means the block was not the reply's
conclusion.

Both of those rules are answered by `_fenced_payload`, which the late mode's
parser beside this one asks about its own fence. What differs between the two
modes is not the envelope but what an ABSENT block means -- a question here, a
protocol failure there -- so the rule they share is spelled once and the
meaning each takes from it stays with its own caller.
