"""The pinned-state fields this stage reads and writes, and how it names children.

Every owner in the package keys the same durable fields, so they are spelled
once here: a typo in a key is a silently-lost park or a parent that forgets its
children, and neither surfaces until an issue is already stuck. `_issue_ref_list`
sits with them because it is the one rendering of those recorded numbers -- the
held-dependency log line, the rejected- and closed-child parks, and the drift
notice all quote children the same way.
