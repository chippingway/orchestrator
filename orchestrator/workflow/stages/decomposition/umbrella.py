"""A parent whose whole intent is covered by its children.

`umbrella` polls exactly like `blocked` -- same rejected / manually-closed
parks, same dep-graph activation walk -- and differs only in what "every child
resolved" earns. There is no implementation pass to re-enter, so the parent
resolves to `done` and closes instead of flipping to `ready`.

That missing implementation pass is also why the drift check matters more here
than anywhere else: no later stage will ever look at this issue's body again,
so a body edited while children ran would otherwise be closed against the
manifest it no longer describes.

It is also the last boundary at which anything the issue still owes a remote
can be settled, and the first at which the snapshot half CAN be. A parent that
became an umbrella through a late split owes two things -- the branch its
superseded candidate was committed on, and the immutable ref that candidate was
preserved under -- and nothing else ever brings a tick back to either, because
an umbrella polls its children and nothing else. So the all-resolved branch
reconciles what is owed before it closes anything: the branch unconditionally,
and the snapshot under the rule that owns it, since every recorded direct
consumer being terminal is exactly what all-resolved has just made true. The
child scan is handed over rather than re-taken, so proving that costs no
request of its own. A remote that refuses holds the parent open, because an
umbrella closed over an unreclaimed ref is an obligation nobody would ever
settle, while one still open is a retry every tick.

All-resolved is not the only reading that makes it true, which is why the same
settlement runs on the way OUT. A child rejected and a child closed by hand
both park this parent for a human, and both closed the child -- which is what
the reclamation rule reads. A park that returned before settling would leave
an owner sitting on a reclaimable ref for as long as the human took, and
nothing sweeps an open umbrella. So the parked path settles from the same
fresh scan that parked it, decides no terminal, and leaves the park exactly as
it was.

    `done` is the write that cannot be recovered from: it takes the issue off
    both labels the closed-owner sweep queries, so nothing would ever visit it
    again. What makes it safe is not a correction behind it but the write
    AHEAD of it -- one pinned write that stamps the resolution and RETIRES the
    generation together, and past which there is no live cycle for a close to
    end.

    So the latch is asked for the last time immediately before that write,
    with no request standing between the answer and it, and a close observed
    there stops the terminal outright: the owner keeps `umbrella` with the
    mark down, and the ending retires it to `rejected` from a label the sweep
    still queries. A close arriving AFTER it is a human closing an issue this
    orchestrator had already finished -- every child resolved, every
    obligation reclaimed, the cycle over -- which is not a cancellation and
    leaves nothing to correct.

    Every window a crash can land in is one the next pass repairs. Before the
    pinned write the owner is on `umbrella` with a live cycle, which is what
    the sweep and the umbrella poll both already own. After it the owner is on
    `umbrella` with the resolution recorded and no cycle at all, and both of
    those passes finish the terminal from the record rather than starting the
    walk again -- which is also why the closing notice is said once, gated on
    the same stamp.

    That write is itself a request, so what the window observed is asked once
    more BEHIND it -- and taken as the window closes rather than before it, so
    no interval is left for a poll to latch a close in. There the answer is
    not a refusal but a reinstatement: the cycle goes back on the record from
    this call's own memory and is cancelled there, so a close observed while
    the cycle was still live is one the ending can still be entered from.
