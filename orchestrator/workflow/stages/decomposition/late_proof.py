"""Where the pull request a verdict was measured against has to be standing.

The deepest question a settled `single` asks, and the only one about a HEAD
rather than about which pull request the issue should carry. It is asked on the
published road alone: a candidate nothing had published has no head to be
compared against, and the search that finds its pull request belongs to the
reconciliation above.

Two heads qualify and every other one is external movement. The frozen head is
the ordinary answer -- nothing has touched the pull request since the reading
the verdict was taken over, and the push that verdict earns is still owed. The
other is the accepted candidate WHERE THE RECORD vouches for having put it
there, which is this settlement's own push having landed before the tick died.
Read as movement, that one would refuse the very publication this verdict made,
forever; recognized, the retry finishes the label and the retirement it never
reached and pushes nothing a second time.

The refusal is owned here as well. Every reconciliation that could not confirm
what it read ends in the same park -- publishing on the strength of a reading
nobody could confirm is the one thing all of this exists to prevent -- and it
sits with the deepest check rather than with the road above it, so the
dependency between the two runs one way.

    The other is the ACCEPTED CANDIDATE where the RECORD says this road put

    That push happens before the relabel and the retirement, so a tick that
    died in between comes back to a live generation over a pull request the

    refused forever is the publication this very verdict made. Recognized,
    the tick carries on from where it stopped: nothing is pushed a second

    finishes.

    The record is what qualifies it, and asking for one is the whole of the
    safety. On a FRESH pass this call runs before the exemption, the approval,
    and the push behind them, so nothing of this workflow's has touched the
    remote yet: a pull request that moved off the frozen head onto the
    candidate moved because something else -- an agent that pushed its own
    commit is the plain case -- put it there, and taking that for a landed
    settlement would publish and hand on a candidate the adjudication was
    never allowed to release. It refuses with every other moved head instead.

    settlement owes exactly that commit a publication; the receipt is written
    by the push itself, in the same write that drops the approval, and says
    the commit reached the remote. A crash anywhere past that write leaves one
    of the two on the pinned comment, so the retry recognizes the publication
    it made -- and a pass that has written neither has made no push to
    recognize.

    The receipt is read with the head it REPLACED, which is what dates it to
    this settlement. It is never cleared, so on its own it goes on naming a
    commit this issue published rounds ago -- and where the accepted candidate
    IS that commit, a pull request somebody rewound onto it would read as this
    settlement's push having landed. The head this verdict was measured over
