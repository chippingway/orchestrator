"""What a late cycle owes once the issue it belongs to is gone.

A human can close a late-split owner at any point of its reconciliation: while
its candidate is being measured, while an agent is deciding, between the
snapshot and the first child, in the middle of the split loop, or long after
the supersession. Every one of those leaves a different amount of this
orchestrator's work standing on somebody's repository, and none of them leaves
a workflow anybody wants resumed. So the close ends the CYCLE, and this owner
is what the ending consists of.

**The mark goes down before anything external happens**, and it is the whole
reason the rest is safe to retry. It says the cycle is over, so no gate below
will spawn an agent, adjudicate, relabel, or create another child; it carries
the moment the cleanup obligation was taken on; and it is irreversible within
the cycle -- a human who reopens the issue gets a fresh cycle rather than this
one resumed, so a later visit re-marks the same cancellation and moves neither
the stamp nor the boundary it was taken at. Being durable first is what lets
every step after it be attempted again: a tick that dies mid-cleanup comes back
to a record that already says what it is doing.

It keeps the boundary as well as the moment, because `cancelling` is itself a
phase and it overwrites the one it interrupted. That phase is what says whether
the consumer ledger accounts for every child cut from the snapshot, so a record
that forgot it could never prove a ref reclaimable again.

**Then the plan pull request, which is the one external thing a cancellation
owns that the umbrella's terminal never sees.** A cycle that reached the size
gate through a design discussion may be holding one under a "do not merge"
notice with the original description preserved on the issue. Nobody is going
to adjudicate it now, so the hold comes off, one notice says why, and the pull
request is closed -- in that order, so a change that ends up closed is not also
left wearing a hold nothing will ever take back. Said at most once, proved from
the pull request's own thread rather than from a record, because the comment
and the entry that records it cannot be made one operation.

Asked again on every visit, though, because a pull request is not a thing that
stays where it was put. The entry records what an earlier visit did, and an
owner still being visited for something else -- a branch the remote will not
delete -- would otherwise take its terminal, leave the sweep for good, and
leave a change a human reopened standing under a cancelled cycle. What is
bounded is the RECORD of it rather than the asking: the write and both sinks
are behind a state that actually moved.

**Everything else is the reclamation owner's, unchanged.** The superseded
branch and the immutable ref are settled by exactly the rules and in exactly
the order the umbrella's terminal settles them in: a branch only where the
target is one this issue is published under, a ref only once every recorded
direct consumer is proved ended on a reading taken this visit, both refused
outright while the obligation ledger holds an entry this binary cannot type.
A cancellation buys no shortcut through any of it -- a child that is live again
keeps the ref whether or not its owner is closed.

One branch is this ending's own to take ON, though, and it is the one the
transaction could not write down in time: the plan PR is superseded and the
branch it carried recorded in two writes, so a close between them leaves a
branch nothing names. Settling around that is retiring over it -- see
`_superseded_branch`.

**Every child that already exists is left entirely alone.** The split records a
child before it seeds one and activates none until the transaction completes,
so a cancellation mid-loop finds real GitHub issues carrying real slices of
somebody's work. What happens to them next is a human's decision, not this
ending's: they are not closed, not relabelled, not written to, and not
commented on -- the receipt a reclamation leaves is what a LIVE split owes the
children it is still responsible for, and a cancelled cycle is responsible for
none of them. A consumer is still READ, because proving each of them ended is
what permits the ref to go at all, and that reading is the whole of what any
of them costs.

Their LEDGER entries are discharged, which is a different thing from touching
them. The ledger is not an inventory of what exists; it is the list of what
this orchestrator still owes somebody's repository, and a cancelled cycle owes
a child nothing -- the entry's obligation was the receipt, and there is no
receipt. Marking them reconciled is a local write to this issue's own pinned
comment, and it is what lets a settled cycle read as settled: leaving them
pending would say the ending is unfinished forever, on an obligation no pass
is ever going to discharge.

Nothing about the ref goes unsaid by that. The transport drops this host's
copy of it before it touches the remote and refuses the whole reclamation if
that copy cannot be proved gone, so a child reopened afterwards finds no
mirror, asks the remote once, and is stopped and told by its own guard on its
own dispatch -- which is where a receipt would only ever have been read.

**A reopen resumes nothing, and skips no part of the ending.** The mark is
irreversible within the cycle, so a human who reopens the issue does not get
that cycle back, and EVERY label names a handler that would act on the issue
rather than settle it. So a cancelled cycle wearing one is refused whatever it
says -- the two an adjudication runs under, the `implementing` a `single`
verdict hands the issue to a moment before a close is observed, and any a
human moved it to since. The same reconciliation is entered from the
dispatcher's own pinned-state guard too, and the same terminal follows it.
Running the cleanup there rather than merely refusing is what makes the
refusal end: the closed-owner sweep visits closed issues only,
so a refusal with nothing behind it would freeze the issue until somebody
closed it again. What the reopen does not earn is a way past the ending -- an
issue worked again without reaching it would be the cancelled cycle resumed by
accident, and the authorization for a fresh attempt is a human taking
`rejected` off, not a human reopening the issue.

**The terminal comes last, and only once nothing is owed** -- branch, ref, and
every unreconciled plan-PR entry the LEDGER holds, which is a wider reading
than what this pass acts on. Acting takes the hold's own record, since
releasing one means knowing which pull request this cycle marked; being owed
takes the ledger, because an entry left under a number a later write cleared
is still an obligation, a retired owner is one nothing revisits, and a restart
counts every unreconciled resource as owed. An owner that has settled all of
them is handed `rejected`, which is both the honest end of the cycle and what
takes the issue out of the closed-owner sweep for good --
every label the sweep queries is one the owner keeps until this write lands,
and this write is the only thing that takes one off. Where it may be written
from is the transition graph's own answer for every label a workflow wrote:
each state a late cycle can be interrupted on declares that edge, and a state
that does not is refused and said out loud instead of relabelled out from
under whoever put the issue there. `ready` and `blocked` are the exception,
and not a human's placement at all: a decomposition run spawned before the
close writes one of them as its ordinary outcome and lands after it, so the
terminal is written from both rather than left refused on every visit the
sweep will make forever. The UNLABELED state is the one exception in the
other direction -- an operator who has taken `rejected` off wears nothing at
all, and re-applying it there would undo the one authorization a restart has.

A control label defers everything past the mark. `backlog` and `paused` park
an issue outside the state machine, and the ending is external work; the fact
that the cycle is over is written all the same, because the pass that would
record it is the only one there is. So a cancellation that finishes costs a bounded number of passes,
and one that cannot -- a remote that refuses a delete, a consumer that is live
again, a ledger a human has to settle -- keeps the label, keeps being visited,
and says on every visit what it is still holding. That is the same bargain the
umbrella's terminal makes, for the same reason: an unreclaimed remote has to
stay visible to somebody.

    What the dispatcher asks before it drops the close a cleanup was carrying,

    nothing. A consumer that is live again holds the ref, a remote that
    refuses a delete holds the branch, a plan pull request a human reopened
    holds itself, and the terminal write is one more request that can be
    declined -- each of them leaves the pass returning normally with the
    ending still owed.

    Held only where nothing ELSE would come back, though, because the reading
    is not the only route: the closed sweep queries the two labels an
    adjudication runs under AND the two an interrupted ending can be left on,
    so an owner still wearing any of the four is one a later tick reaches on
    the sweep's own cadence -- which is the budget an operator set. Holding a
    reading over it would buy nothing and cost a cleanup pass per tick for as
    long as the ending is owed, and an ending can be owed for a very long
    time: a consumer that is live again keeps the ref until somebody ends it.

    What it covers is the label OUTSIDE all four, which is where a hand
    relabel or a terminal correction can leave an owner mid-ending. The sweep
    repairs that label where it can, so what the reading is really holding is
    the pass whose repair GitHub refused -- and there it is the only route
    left, until the process carrying it exits.

    An owner that is OPEN again is settled rather than held, and that is not
    the same as finished. The sweep may act externally on nobody's reopened
    issue -- it marks the cancellation and stops -- so holding the reading
    would route the owner back to a pass that is forbidden to advance it,

    second writer racing the worker that owns the issue would drop whatever
    that worker recorded in between. A comment is added, so it races nothing.

    What reads it back is the process AFTER this one. The latch covers every
    observation this process makes -- the run holding the issue asks it before
    every step the remote keeps -- and what no latch survives is a restart, so
    the receipt is here for the tick that comes up against a cycle a dead
    process was already ending.

    Skipped where there is nothing to end: an owner with no cycle, and one
    whose record already carries the mark. Skipped too where the thread
    already says it, since a receipt is one sentence rather than one per poll
    that observes the same close.

    Retried, though, for as long as the thread does not have one. Raising
    here would cost the tick that was posting it, so a refusal is logged and
    the latch carries the observation meanwhile -- but a latch is memory, and
    an observation whose receipt never landed is one a restart takes away
    entirely. So the memo that suppresses the second attempt is written by
    the attempt that SUCCEEDED, and every later poll tries again until one
    does.

    Under a claim, because asking and posting cannot be made one operation.
    The claim is what stops two polls in that gap -- a worker's failed pass
    and the next tick's enumeration meet there -- from walking the same
    receipt-less thread and posting one apiece, and it carries the GENERATION
    of the reading it was taken for: a cleanup settling the observation
    mid-post has already dropped the memo on purpose, and re-creating it
    would suppress the next close's receipt for a reading nobody holds. Handed
    back either way, since a claim over an attempt that ended would suppress
    every later poll's receipt for good.

    Answers whether the reading is one a later pass still has to be handed,
    off the SAME record read the receipt was written from. The two questions
    were once asked of two reads, and two reads of a record a worker is
    writing can disagree: one saw a cycle and kept the observation while the
    other saw the retirement behind it and left the thread saying nothing, so
    the reading survived in memory alone and a restart took it. One read
    answers both, and a read that established nothing keeps the reading --
    which is the answer a request that failed is entitled to give.

    `polled` is the object the caller already has, where it has one. The
    enumeration writes the receipt from the issue it just listed rather than
    fetching the same one again, which is the whole of what asking at poll

    dispatched to the handler its label names, and EVERY label names a handler
    that acts: one spawns the decomposer, one walks the dependency graph and
    activates children, the rest drive a delivery stage against a branch and a
    pull request this cycle no longer owns. Any of them would be the cancelled
    cycle resumed, so none of them is reached -- what the label is decides
    nothing about whether this refuses.

    What it does decide is where the ending can be written. `rejected` is what
    the CYCLE earns rather than what a closed issue earns: it is what the
    operator removes to authorize a restart, and reaching it is the only way
    back into ordinary work that does not silently resume a cycle a close
    already ended. It is written from the states the transition graph declares
    the edge from and nowhere else -- under a label it does not, the
    reconciliation still runs, the refusal still stands, and the cycle stays
    cancelled where it is rather than being relabelled out from under whoever
    put the issue there. A reopened owner that settles is retired exactly as a
    closed one is, and left open, since closing an issue a human just reopened
    is not this owner's to do.

    Running the reconciliation rather than merely refusing is what makes the
    refusal end: the closed-owner sweep visits closed issues only, so this is
    the one pass that would ever come back to a reopened owner, and a refusal
    with nothing behind it would freeze the issue until somebody closed it
    again.

    The unlabeled state is the one exception to all of it, because it is the
    restart handshake itself: an issue an operator has taken `rejected` off
    wears no label at all. There this stops an issue only while its cancelled
    cycle still OWES something -- that obligation is real wherever the label
    went -- and is otherwise this owner's business no longer.

    this cycle marked, and closing anything else would end a change no
