"""The checkout a finished developer run left, proved and re-frozen.

What comes back is not trusted, it is proved. The tree has to be clean before
anything is read off it -- a candidate measured beside uncommitted changes is
not the candidate a publication would push -- and the commit the checkout ends
on is frozen and measured again from scratch, under the ceiling as it stands
now. What is NOT allowed is skipping the measurement, which is why the
generation counter advances on every reconciliation that lands -- the recorded
verdict is keyed on cycle, generation, and commit, so a candidate adjudicated
before the requirements moved has to be adjudicated again rather than answered
from the record taken before they did.

The resulting SHA is allowed to be the one that went in, but only when the
developer SAID so. "The committed work already covers this" is a real answer
and it is written down: the revision prompt asks for the same `ACK:` marker
every other drift resume asks for, and a marker is what an unchanged commit
needs before it is re-measured. Without one, an unchanged commit is not an
acknowledgment -- it is a run that said nothing, asked a question, or timed out
before it could do either, and all three look identical from the checkout.
Reading any of them as "the work already covers it" would advance a generation
and adjudicate a candidate nobody vouched for, so they park instead, quoting
whatever the developer did say so a question reaches the human it was meant
for.

A reconciliation that could not be completed parks and keeps the generation
exactly as it was. Neither of those parks is superseded by another attempt --
a dirty checkout and a measurement nothing could take are both waiting on a
human to touch the worktree -- so a bare continue re-runs this reconciliation
alone, without paying for a second developer run that already finished.

Every reconciliation of a developer run ends where a finished adjudication
does: the owner is read again. The developer has just run for as long as it
ran, and a human who closed the issue in between has ended the whole cycle
rather than this tick -- which is as true of a reconciliation that parked as
of one that landed, so both are read past. The read sits after everything the
reconciliation made durable and before anything it would SAY: the re-measured
candidate and the park are written whatever the answer turns out to be, so a
comment GitHub refuses costs neither, and the notice each of them owes is
posted only once the issue is known to still be there.

The obligation to take that read is part of what is written, not something
the step after it adds. A re-measured candidate is the one result that can
route a later tick past the read entirely -- under the ceiling it is not
adjudicable, and over it the advanced generation has no recorded answer to
short-circuit the spawn -- so the two go down together and a tick that dies
between them leaves an issue that still owes the read.

A reconciliation that PARKED writes on the same terms and for a sharper
reason. The developer finished, and the guidance that bought it was consumed
in memory on the way in -- so a park left staged until the guard would, on a
tick that died before it, take the consumed reply down with it: the next tick
would find the same comment unread and resume the developer a second time,
against a checkout nobody has cleaned. The park, the consumption, and the
owed read are therefore one write, made here, before the read.

Nothing here reaches back to the entry coordinator. Both roads in -- the
guidance that bought a developer run, and the bare continue that re-reads a
run which already finished -- call in from there, and a reconciliation that
had to ask what brought it would be deciding the caller's question again.
