"""The push an accepted candidate earns, and the checkout it is handed on with.

Only a verdict taken PAST publication owes a push here, and the reason it is
made on this tick rather than by the stage the issue continues at is that only
this tick still holds the evidence. The verdict was taken against one pull
request standing on one head, the reconciliation ahead of this proved both are
still what they were, and the retirement behind it takes the record that said
so away. The stage resumed afterwards has its own completion to finish and no
way to re-derive any of that -- and two of the five have no publication seam a
resumed tick would even reach. So the branch is put where the verdict said it
may go, named against the accepted commit and pinned to the head the reading
was taken over, and the stage picks up from a pull request that carries it.

A pre-publication verdict pushes nothing: its candidate has no pull request
yet, and the ordinary `implementing` publication it is handed back to is what
opens one. Neither does a retry finishing a settlement whose push already
landed -- the pull request is standing on the accepted candidate, and what is
left to finish is the label and the retirement.

Both of those still owe the CHECKOUT, which is why the proof is on the road out
rather than inside the push. What the verdict licensed is one commit, and the
worktree it was accepted from is writable through the whole adjudication,
through the push itself, and through the tick that died between a landed push
and the retry that finds it.

    a head ahead of the pushed branch as unpublished work, the squash rewrites
