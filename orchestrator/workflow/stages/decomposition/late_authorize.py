"""The one decision that publishes an oversized candidate a human has read.

The other side of the park beside this. `late_unsplit` is what the workflow
does when an adjudicator answers that an oversized change stays one change --
it stops, because the ceiling exists so unreviewed bulk does not reach a pull
request and an agent proposing to publish past it is the thing being guarded
against. This owner is what ENDS that stop: an operator who has read the
change saying, in a comment on the issue, that it publishes as it stands.

It is a dedicated command and not a reply, and every term of that follows from
what it licenses. A generic `/orchestrator continue` says "the step you
described failed for a reason nobody has to answer, do it again", which is not
a decision about a change anybody read -- so it is refused here rather than
absorbed. Ordinary prose is guidance: it says the work itself has to change,
which resumes the developer and re-measures whatever comes back, and reading
it as consent would publish a candidate on the strength of somebody agreeing
that something was hard. And the command names the exact commit, because a
bare "yes" would authorize whatever the worktree ends on next.

Only the WHOLE comment is the command. A line of it under a paragraph is a
paragraph that mentions it -- guidance, carried to the developer with
everything else the human wrote -- and that split is what makes the two
answers unambiguous rather than a matter of which the reader saw first.

Who may say it is the allowlist every other workflow-driving comment on a
public thread goes through, applied where the thread is read: an outsider's
comment is not in the reading this owner is handed, so nothing they post can
be an authorization, become guidance, or move a watermark. WHEN they may say
it is bounded the same way every reply is: a comment written before the park's
own notice is not an answer to it, since the human had not been told anything
yet, so a command posted ahead of the question it answers goes stale rather
than authorizing the candidate it happened to name.

What a command that IS all of those things earns is a proof and then a record.
The proof is the contribution recomputed here, between the frozen pair, in the
developer's own worktree -- not read off anything stored, because a digest a
caller handed in proves only that a caller had one. The record is the
`late_split/overrides` group, which is durable evidence and publishes nothing:
it names the candidate, the base it was read over, that recomputed digest and
the scheme it was taken under, the measurement that made the candidate
oversized, and the comment the authorization was made in.

That record and the park coming down and the reply being consumed are ONE
write, and they have to be. A park cleared without the record would send the
candidate straight back into the adjudication a human just answered; a record
without the consumed watermark would let the same comment authorize a second
candidate later; and either half landing alone is a state a crash could leave.
Past that write the tick carries on to the answer it already had, which is
where the publication is decided -- `late_settlement` asks this owner whether
an authorization still covers the candidate in hand, and settles the recorded
`single` where it does.

Everything that cannot be proved is answered on the thread and consumed --
once, under a receipt scoped to the reading it answers, because the sentence
and the write that consumes it are two operations and a tick can die between
them. Where those answers differ is what they leave standing. A command naming
another commit leaves the park exactly where it is: the same decision is owed,
and the notice explaining it is still the last word above the refusal. One
arriving over an adjudication the record can no longer show retires it, and
has to -- there is nothing to be owed until something adjudicates the
candidate again, and `awaiting_human` is the flag that suppresses the
announcement a categorized question earns, so a park left standing over that
run would cost a human the one sentence nothing else will ever say.

A contribution this host could not fingerprint is not answered at all --
nothing about it is the human's doing, the next tick takes the same reading
again, and consuming their command would lose an authorization they would have
to make twice.

The publication asks for that fingerprint AGAIN, and every term of the record
with it. The settlement can be reached by a later poll, on a later process,
and on a host that never held the content between the frozen pair -- so what
licenses it is the objects agreeing with the record rather than the record
agreeing with itself, which is the one thing a hand edit and a half-written
crash can both arrange.

What none of those terms can say is WHICH answer was authorized. They describe
a candidate, and a candidate can be adjudicated more than once: a certificate
over edited requirements throws the recorded verdict away and buys a fresh
one, and a revision advances the generation and buys another, both against
requirements a human has since changed. Every term here would still match, so
the record is bound to that answer by being DROPPED with it: `late_session`
drops it where a result is thrown away and again where the run replacing that
result is recorded, which is the statement of the rule no road gets around,
and `late_revision_reconciliation` drops it where a re-freeze mints a fresh
question. An authorization outliving the answer it was given for is the one
shape it may not take: it would license the next adjudication's `single` on a
permission nobody granted it.
