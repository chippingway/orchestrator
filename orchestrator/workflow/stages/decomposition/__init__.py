"""How one issue becomes a manifest, and what that manifest becomes.

Four workflow labels share this package because they share one artifact. The
decomposer runs on `decomposing` and answers with a single fenced manifest;
`single` sends the issue straight to `ready`, and `split` turns the manifest's
children into real GitHub issues and leaves the parent on `blocked` or
`umbrella` until every one of them resolves. The parent-side labels are the
back half of the same decision, so the manifest that produced the children and
the walk that waits on them belong in one package rather than one per label.

The owners divide by what each is responsible for rather than by label:
`manifest` and `validation` decide what the agent's reply is allowed to be,
`session` owns the decomposer session an issue is locked to and every spawn or
resume under it, `retry_cap` owns the park a spent spawn budget leaves an
INITIAL decomposition -- held ahead of every road that would walk past one, and
lifted only by the command that renews the budget -- `run` owns the order one
tick asks the others in and `outcomes` the three dispositions its reply earns,
`recovery` owns what a tick that died mid-split left behind, `split` owns the
crash-safe order children are created in, and `parents`, `activation`,
`blocked`, and `umbrella` own the parent-side polling that drives the tree to
completion.

The `late_*` owners are an additive second mode under the same `decomposing`
label, for the issue whose implementation is already committed and turns out to
be oversized. They are named apart rather than folded in because what a missing
or malformed INITIAL manifest means may not change: `late_prompt` and
`late_reply` are the question that mode asks and the fence it is answered on,
`late_hold` owns the cycle-marked hold a reusable pull request wears while the
question is open -- the plan one where the gate was entered before publication,
and the implementation one the work is already on where it was entered past it
-- `late_session` owns the run's pinned record and the tracked spawn over it,
`late_content` fingerprints the requirements the candidate was frozen against
and `late_guidance` decides what a change to them or an answer about them
earns, `late_revision` owns the developer run guidance buys and the re-measured
candidate it comes back with, `late_relabel` owns the label a live generation
pins against the kill switch and a hand relabel, `late_owner` owns the fresh
read that stands between a finished run and anything it earns,
`late_settlement` owns what a guarded verdict becomes, `late_retry_cap` owns
the same spent-budget park on this mode's road -- the gate its one spawn is
charged to, and the hold that keeps a park nothing supersedes ahead of the
evidence probe, the pull-request hold, and the content read -- `late_notice`
owns the sentence any late park still owes the thread, `late_coordinator` owns
the order those are asked in and `late_outcome` what one finished reply
becomes, and `late_models` carries what they hand each other. The budget both
`retry_cap` owners are decided by is neither of theirs: it is the shared
`engine/retry_budget.py`, so a park taken on either road is the same durable
reason, answered by the same command, and audited on the same stream.
`late_snapshot`, `late_children`, and `late_transaction` are the ordered split
itself -- the candidate preserved on an immutable ref, the children cut from
it, and the supersession behind them -- while `late_cleanup` owns what that
leaves the remote holding, `late_cancellation` owns the irreversible ending an
owner observed closed earns, `late_sweep` is the cleanup-only pass that
revisits an owner a human closed mid-cycle, and `late_restart` owns the fresh
cycle an operator authorizes by taking that ending's `rejected` back off. What
puts an issue in front of them is the size gate at the implementing package's
publication seam, and what reaches them is the first question a `decomposing`
tick asks: a record carrying a live generation belongs to the coordinator
entire, and no step of the initial decomposition runs for it. Two answers short
of one are routed rather than adjudicated -- a settled candidate the
measurement put back under the ceiling goes to `workflow:implementing` for
publication, and `DECOMPOSE=off` may not route an unadjudicated one there at
all -- so the four labels above are still the whole of what this package
answers for. `handoff` owns both of those routes, together because neither is a
decomposition and both end the same way: the label moves and the implementing
handler runs on the same tick, against an issue read back after the write
rather than the stale object that write was made against.

Callers import the owner they need, so this initializer binds nothing: the
dispatcher resolves one handler per label, and an eager binding here would
charge the `blocked` walk for the manifest parser and the split writer it
never reaches.
