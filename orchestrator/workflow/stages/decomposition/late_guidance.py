"""What the humans have said since the candidate was frozen, and what it earns.

One question asked of every tick that reaches a live oversized generation:
have the requirements moved, and has anybody answered? The fingerprints beside
this owner say which; this one decides what each answer is worth.

Drift outranks every answer, and that is the whole rule. An edit to the title,
the body, or a comment already counted into the baseline changes what the
candidate is supposed to be, and an answer that arrived in the same window was
written about the scope as it stood before -- applying it would adjudicate a
reply against requirements it never saw. So the first tick that sees drift
parks and consumes nothing: the frozen commit, the late session, the
generation record, and any hold it took are all left exactly as they were,
because none of them is wrong, only unadjudicable until a human says what the
edit meant.

Once that park stands, the human's reply is what resolves it, and the two
kinds of reply mean opposite things. A bare `/orchestrator continue` is a
certificate: the committed work still answers the updated issue, so the
fingerprints are re-baselined onto the content as it now reads and the same
frozen candidate goes on to be adjudicated -- against the updated
requirements, which is why a verdict recorded before the edit is dropped
rather than reused. Substantive guidance is not a certificate -- it says the
work itself has to change, so the original developer session is resumed
against it and the candidate is re-frozen and re-measured from what comes
back.

Guidance means the same thing when nothing is parked at all. An adjudication
in flight, or one that already recorded a verdict, is still work a human can
ask to be different -- so the developer is resumed there too, and the
re-measured candidate that comes back is what retires a verdict taken over
work the human has since changed. The only reply with nothing to do is a bare
continue arriving where no park is waiting on it.

The other park this owner answers is the categorized question, and it is the
one place the two replies are not symmetric. Only substantive guidance
reopens it: the recorded outcome is dropped so the adjudicator runs again
against the human's answer. A bare continue may not, because a question is not
a step that failed and "proceed" is not an answer to "which half of this is in
scope" -- it is refused, and the issue stays parked on the question it is
really waiting on.

Everything this owner stages, it persists. The parks are external effects
that go out after the durable write, and the one branch that stages nothing --
an unchanged, un-answered park -- deliberately writes nothing at all, so an
issue waiting on a human costs no comment write per tick.
