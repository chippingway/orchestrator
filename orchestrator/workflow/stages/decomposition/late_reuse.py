"""What a child born of a split proves before it starts on what it was cut from.

A late split hands each child a pointer to an immutable ref and tells it to
reuse the candidate under it. That ref does not live forever: it is reclaimed
once every child cut from it has ended, and a human is free to reopen one
afterwards. So the pointer a child carries is a claim about the past, and the
one moment it matters is the moment the child is about to act on it.

This is the guard at that moment, and it is deliberately the CHILD's own. The
owner that reclaimed the ref cannot make this safe from its side: it would be
writing another live issue's pinned comment from a worker of its own, and that
comment is written whole -- a terminal finalize that read it first and wrote it
after would put the reclaimed pointer back and take any park off, with nothing
left to notice. Evaluated here instead, on the issue's own dispatch, there is
nobody to race: whatever a concurrent writer did to the record, the child reads
it again and decides again.

The dispatcher is where it runs, ahead of every handler and ahead of the
terminal no-op. That last one is the point: a consumer that ended is `done` or
`rejected`, and reopening one leaves the label exactly where it was -- so the
issue a human brings back is precisely the issue the dispatcher would otherwise
have nothing to do with. Running here also means no route around it: a relabel
straight to another stage is dispatched through the same seam.

Two things can answer it, and the first outranks the second.

**The receipt the reclamation left.** As a ref goes, its owner posts one
comment on each child cut from it, marked with that owner, cycle, and
generation. That marker is the authoritative answer, because it says what
HAPPENED rather than what a later reading of the world suggests: a mirror this
host never got round to dropping, or a ref somebody pushed again at the same
commit, would both make the world look untouched while the candidate the child
was promised is no longer one anybody vouches for. Read off the thread and only
from a comment of ours, so neither a stale local ref nor a third party's forged
marker can speak for a reclamation. A child that has never been split into
carries no ancestry and never asks; one whose pointer this guard has already
dropped never asks again.

A thread that could not be READ is not a thread with no receipt on it, and the
difference decides the tick. Everything behind this reading can look untouched
while the answer that outranks it sits unseen -- a mirror nobody dropped, a ref
pushed again at the same commit -- so an unreadable thread holds the dispatch
rather than falling through to readings it would have overruled.

**What the world says, when no receipt does.** A reclamation whose receipt
never landed -- a crash, a thread that could not be posted to -- still has to
stop the child, so the ref is asked about. This host first, and that shortcut
is bought by the ORDER the reclamation runs in rather than assumed of it: the
local mirror is taken down before the remote ref is touched at all, and a
mirror that cannot be proved gone stops the reclamation instead of being
logged past. So a mirror still here says nothing has been reclaimed, and only
a mirror that is gone is worth one `ls-remote`.

"Still here" is an identity, not an existence. The mirror is a ref in the
object store every agent's worktree shares, so what the name resolves to is
the whole of what it proves: a copy at the exact commit this child was
promised is the reclamation-has-not-happened reading, and a copy at anything
else is somebody's write, which says nothing about the ref on the remote and
is not a candidate this child may work from either. Both of those go to the
ask.

That shortcut is taken only where the pointer itself says it may be. An
ancestry written before the reclamation put this host's copy first is a
pointer into a world where the remote went first and the mirror came down
best-effort -- so a surviving mirror there is as likely to be the residue of a
reclamation that finished as proof one never started, and the child pays a
read-only ask rather than trusting it. Nothing migrates: the stamp is written
by the binary that would do the reclaiming, and its absence is the whole
question answered.

Three answers come back and each is a different verdict. A proved absence is
the reclamation this child was not told about. A `MISMATCH` is the ref
carrying somebody else's commit, which is not the candidate this child was
promised and is not a thing to start work against either -- the reclamation
refuses one for a human, and so does this. `UNREADABLE` is neither: it is an
outage, and an outage is not evidence about anything, so the dispatch is HELD
rather than parked or waved through. Held is the cheap direction -- the child
is looked at again on the next tick and no comment, label, or park is written
-- while waving it through spawns an agent against instructions naming a ref
nobody could vouch for.

One shape has neither pointer nor pinned lineage, and it still has to stop.
The split records a child on the parent's ledger before it seeds that child's
ancestry -- a child on GitHub the parent does not record is a child nothing
would come back to -- so a seed that failed leaves an issue whose BODY tells it
to reuse a snapshot and whose pinned comment says nothing. The reclamation
counts it as a consumer all the same, and leaves its receipt on it all the
same. The body's own marker is what says this is a child of a split, and it
costs nothing to read.

It is also the one lineage claim here that comes out of a field the world can
write, and every claim it competes with is authenticated: a pinned comment
only this orchestrator writes, a receipt checked against its author. So it is
CORROBORATED rather than believed. The marker names an owner, a cycle, and a
generation; the owner's own record is read fresh and has to name the same
cycle and generation and carry this issue's number among the consumers it cut
from that ref. A claim it does not vouch for is a claim about nothing, and the
guard steps aside -- parking an issue on the strength of a sentence somebody
typed into its body is exactly the denial of service that reading a body as
authority buys.

A vouched claim yields the whole pointer the failed seed never wrote: the ref
the identity mints, and the commit the owner recorded preserving. That is what
makes the ask the same ask the recorded shape makes -- whether THIS candidate
is still obtainable -- rather than whether some name is occupied. And the ask
has to happen, because the receipt cannot cover the window it is posted after:
a ref is deleted first, so a silent thread is what that window looks like, and
so is a thread this tick could not read. A record nobody could read holds the
dispatch instead; it may well be true and this tick cannot tell.

The park is the whole point rather than a formality: it is what stops an
implementation from running against instructions naming a ref that no longer
exists, and it says what continuing takes -- an ordinary change, or an explicit
new split cycle on the owner, which preserves a candidate of its own.

    in the rendered thread and trivially copied, so without it a third party
    could park any child of any split by pasting one.

    Three answers, and no caller may collapse two of them. A receipt is the
    reclamation itself and outranks every later reading of the ref, so it is
    `RECLAIMED`. A thread read to the end with no receipt on it says nothing
    at all, and hands the question to the readings behind this one -- `None`,
    which is not a verdict. A thread that could NOT be read is neither: it is
    the one state where the authoritative answer may exist and be unseen,
    while everything behind it can look untouched -- a mirror nobody dropped,
    a ref pushed again at the same commit -- so it holds the dispatch instead
    of falling through to them.
