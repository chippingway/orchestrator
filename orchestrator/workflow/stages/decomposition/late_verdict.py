"""One finished reply, read and recorded as the verdict it decided.

What a late run's answer MEANS, split from the completion bookkeeping
`late_outcome` owns beside it the way `outcomes.py` is split from `run.py`.
What is here is the reading, the bound a split is refused at, the record it
becomes, and the one sentence a question owes the issue; what a completion
writes and hands back, and the emissions that report it, are that owner's.

The ordering rule the exits here obey is the one `late_parks` owns -- the
durable write goes out before the external effect, never after -- and a
completed adjudication is what makes it worth obeying. The agent has already
been paid for by the time a reply is read, so a crash between reading it and
recording it costs a second run of an agent that already answered. The result
is therefore written and persisted BEFORE anything is posted, and the
announcement a question owes the issue is reconciled from that record on a
later tick rather than being the only place the outcome exists. What the
narrow crash window between the post and the write can still cost is one
repeated comment -- the same window every park in this repository has -- and
never the run.

`_announce` is published for the same reason it is not called from the step
that records an outcome: the owner guard runs between the record and anything
said out loud, so what posts a question is the step past that guard rather
than the step that wrote it down.

The lineage bound is enforced here rather than in the parser, because it is a
property of the generation and not of the reply. A structurally valid split
proposed at the bound is recorded as the categorized question it actually is:
the workflow is asking a human, the recorded outcome says so, and the next
tick does not pay for another agent to propose the same forbidden split.

What this owner deliberately does NOT do is act on the verdict it recorded.
Restoring or superseding the held pull request, creating children, and pushing
an accepted candidate all belong to the steps the guard hands a verdict on to.

    The persist is first and unconditional. Everything after it -- the two
    sinks, and the comment a question owes the issue -- is an external effect
    that a crash may repeat, and repeating one of those costs a duplicate
    record or a duplicate comment. Repeating what comes before it would cost
    another agent run against a candidate that has already been adjudicated,
    and a second run is free to decide differently.

    An outcome the record could not hold is the one case that never becomes
    an answer at all: nothing durable stands behind it, so acting on it would
    leave the issue decided in a way no later tick could see. It parks
    instead, and the park is staged BEFORE the write rather than after it, so
    the one write carries whichever of the two this run produced.

    Size is the only thing asked, and it is asked of the COMMENT. How an
    explanation will render on the thread is not a reason to refuse the
    verdict that carries it: this park is superseded by the next attempt, so a
    refusal here buys another agent run against a candidate that has already
    been adjudicated -- and a `single` refused that way never reaches the
    durable park a human's decision is owed on. What the sentence does with an
    explanation it cannot block off is `late_notice`'s own answer, and it
    keeps every word of it.

    What it deliberately does NOT do is announce. The announcement is an
    external effect on the issue, and whether the issue is still there is the
    owner guard's question -- which is asked between this write and anything
    said out loud, so a question is not posted to a thread somebody closed
