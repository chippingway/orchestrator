"""The prompt one late adjudication is spawned with, and only that one.

Built beside its single caller rather than with the shared builders, the way
the drift-resume prompt is: nothing else asks this question. It opens on the
same header every conversation-carrying prompt does -- the issue body, the
trust-filtered thread, the tracked-repository block -- so an untrusted author's
comment is as absent here as it is from the implement and decompose prompts.

What it adds is everything the late question needs and the initial one never
had: that committed work ALREADY exists and is not to be rewritten, the
declared scope this generation owns, the two frozen commits the diff is to be
read between, the measurement that brought the candidate here, and where the
issue sits in its lineage.

The diff it names is the three-dot one, because that is the range the
measurement was taken over. Two dots would show everything that happened on
the base since the candidate branched as well, so on a diverged history the
agent would be adjudicating changes nobody measured -- and deciding a split
over work this candidate does not add.

Three numbers in it are read back off the owners that enforce them rather than
typed in, for the reason the child cap already is: a bound an agent is told and
a bound it is judged against must be one number. The child cap comes from the
split validator, the lineage bound from the record whose invariant it is, and
the category vocabulary from the closed set a verdict is recorded under -- so a
category widened in review reaches the prompt with it, and one an agent
invents still records as `unknown`.

The per-child addition budget is the fourth, and it is this generation's own
ceiling rather than the configured one: the reply is judged against the number
this candidate was measured against, so an operator retuning the knob while an
agent is running cannot leave that agent sizing children under a bound nothing
checks. A generation that cannot say what its ceiling was still asks for the
number, worded on the measurement above rather than on a figure nobody has.

The two field NAMES in it are read the same way and for the same reason: each
comes from the owner that reads it back. The explanation a `single` is asked
for is the reply parser's, since nothing else ever reads one; the budget every
proposed child owes is the shared budget owner's, since the reply, the record,
and the child issue created from a slice all read the same field. A prompt
asking for one key while the reply is read for another would leave every
conforming answer with nothing recorded about why a split was not proposed, and
every conforming split refused over a field nobody asked for.

What a `single` EARNS is named too, because the prompt must not tell an agent
it is deciding something it is not. That verdict publishes nothing: the ceiling
exists so unreviewed bulk does not reach a pull request, so an oversized change
is published unsplit only on a human's decision, and the verdict is what hands
the issue to them. An agent told the orchestrator would publish on its word is
one weighing a consequence the workflow does not give it. Which is also why the
explanation is asked for as an obligation rather than as a nicety: what the
human is handed is a decision, and a `single` with nothing in it about why a
safe split was unavailable hands them the decision without the one thing it
turns on. The parser refuses such a reply, so the obligation this prompt states
is the one the answer is judged by rather than advice beside it.

The way out of that decision is named beside it, because it is the one an
agent otherwise talks itself out of. Work that will not cut across features
almost always cuts along its dependencies: a prerequisite lands first and may
land DORMANT -- built, tested directly, reached by nothing in production -- with
its activation waiting for the last consumer that needs it, recovery paths
included. Unsaid, "none of this works until all of it exists" reads as proof
that no safe split exists, and the `single` that follows is one a human then
has to answer for. Each child is told to own its own tests and documentation
for the same reason: a slice whose proof or description belongs to a sibling
is not a slice, and a child carrying somebody else's tests is a change nobody
can review on its own.

The budget beside them is what keeps a split proposal actionable rather than
merely plausible. A child estimated at or above the ceiling this candidate was
measured against would arrive back here as another oversized candidate, so the
number is required, bounded, and refused where it does not clear -- and the
prompt asks for headroom under the bound rather than a number that only just
fits, because the review fixes that follow land on the same pull request. The
figure the JSON template shows is scaled to that same bound, for the reason
every other bound here is read off its owner: a template is copied verbatim, so
a standing figure would be a child this binary refuses on every repository
whose ceiling is configured below it -- the prompt would be handing out the one
shape that parks the candidate it is about. What it is not is a promise
anything later honours: the cumulative measurement of a
child's own diff is what decides whether that child is oversized, and the
prompt says so rather than leaving an agent to think a declared number buys it
anything.

The false positives are named out loud because the gate is a size gate and
size is not the question. A diff dominated by legitimate generated or data
artifacts is a small change with a large diff and gets a fast `single`; the
same artifacts looking like something nobody should have committed are a
question for a human, not a verdict for an agent. Saying both in the prompt is
what keeps the first from being split and the second from being waved through.
