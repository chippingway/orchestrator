"""The one pass that comes back to an owner nobody will dispatch again.

A split records what it owes the remote on the generation ledger and lets the
umbrella's terminal settle it. That works for every issue that reaches the
terminal. It does not work for the one a human closed halfway: a closed
`decomposing` or `umbrella` issue is outside every other pass this
orchestrator makes, so the branch its superseded candidate sat on, the
immutable ref its children were cut from, and the pull request it was holding
would be held by a repository nothing ever asked about again.

So this owner exists, and its whole shape is decided by what it must NOT do.
It is cleanup, not recovery: no agent is spawned, no workflow is resumed, no
child is created or activated, and no child that already exists is touched at
all. The issue is closed, and the close is a human decision this pass has no
standing to reverse -- what it acts on is the cycle, which ends, and the
ledger, which is the record of what the orchestrator put on somebody's
repository and is therefore the one thing it still owes.

What that ending consists of is the cancellation owner's, next door: the mark
that goes down before any external call, the held pull request it closes over
one notice, the branch and the ref it hands to the reclamation rules unchanged,
and the `rejected` terminal a fully settled cycle earns. What is here is one
of the two entries into it -- the re-read of the close, and the one reading
that says whether there is a cycle to end at all. The other is the
dispatcher's own guard, which takes the same ending for an owner a human
reopened before it finished.

The close is re-read rather than trusted because the reading that routed this
issue was taken on the polling thread and the worker refetched it afterwards.
What that second reading decides is what this pass DOES, though, and never
whether the cycle ends: being here at all means a close was observed, by the
poll that yielded the issue or by the dispatcher that routed it, and an
observed close cancels the generation irreversibly. So an issue that is open
again is marked all the same and stopped there -- nothing external is done to
an issue somebody just reopened, and the ending it now owes is the
dispatcher's own guard's from the next tick, which is the one pass that owns a
reopened cancelled owner.

An issue with no recorded generation is every issue the initial decomposer
ever made, and it leaves without a write of its own.

Nothing here decides a terminal by measuring the workflow. The umbrella's own
branch is where a settled ledger earns a `done`, and an issue a human already
closed has nothing left to earn -- so the only terminal this path ever writes
is the one that says the cycle it was carrying ended without publishing.

The other label it writes is not a terminal and is not a decision about the
workflow either: it is what keeps a closed owner reachable. This sweep queries
four labels -- the two an adjudication runs under, and the two an interrupted
ending can be left on by a decomposition outcome that landed after the close
was observed -- and an owner moved off all four by hand is one nothing would
bring a tick back to. So an owner that still owes the remote is put back under
one the sweep asks for, and the held observation covers the window until it is.

    """Settle what one closed snapshot owner still owes the remote.

    The whole of what a closed owner earns. It is reached only from the
    dispatcher's cleanup route, which is what guarantees the properties this
    pass is allowed to have: an issue on this path is never handed to the
    stage handler its label names, so nothing below can spawn the decomposer,
    resume an adjudication, or walk the dependency graph.

    Reaching it is also what says a close was OBSERVED -- the route is taken
    on a closed reading and on nothing else -- so an issue this pass finds
    open again has been reopened since that reading rather than never closed.
    It is marked cancelled all the same, because an observed close ends the
    cycle irreversibly, and nothing else is done to it here: acting externally
    on an issue somebody has just reopened is not this pass's to do, and the
    mark is what hands it to the dispatcher's own guard, which owns a reopened
    cancelled owner from the next tick and settles it there.

    An owner with no cycle left is asked one question before it is stepped
    over, and then finished rather than stepped over. The question is the
    retirement's own correlation: a terminal that made its retirement durable
    and then died leaves a record naming which cycle it dropped, and a close
    observed inside that write leaves a receipt on the thread naming the same
    one. Where the two agree the cycle goes back cancelled and this pass ends
    it like any other. Where they do not -- no correlation, or no receipt --
    what is left is an umbrella whose terminal is due and whose label never
    landed, which is `umbrella` and closed, exactly what this sweep queries.

    An owner the pass leaves still owing something is put back under a label
    the sweep queries -- see `_kept_in_the_sweep`. The observation that routed
    this visit is memory, and the label is the only durable thing that reaches
    a closed issue, so an ending left under a label outside the queried four
    would otherwise be finished by no later process.

    two an adjudication runs under and the two an interrupted ending can be

    tick back to. A hand relabel puts an owner there, and so does an operator

    something.

    Only while something is still OWED, and only from a label outside those
    four. An ending that finished wrote `rejected` and is meant to leave the
