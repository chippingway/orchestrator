"""The squash this issue began, answered before anything else runs an agent.

A collapse record is written before the reset that makes one and dropped by
whatever finishes or undoes it, so a comment still carrying one says a rewrite
of this branch is outstanding. What that costs depends entirely on when the
question is asked.

Asked only on the approval road, it is not asked at all on any tick whose
reviewer times out, crashes, or votes `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. A collapse the
remote already carries then never gets the notice, the watermarks, and the
relabel its handoff owes; a record this build cannot read never gets the park
it owes; and the dev is resumed on a branch standing on a commit nobody
accounted for, with `fixing` next.

So it is asked HERE, and it is the same tail the approval road runs: what the
branch is owed does not depend on which reading sent the tick. An issue with
nothing recorded answers False in one dict lookup and costs the stage nothing.

It sits ABOVE every route that can produce an agent -- the drift resume and
the awaiting-human branch both -- because a branch mid-rewrite is not one any
agent may be pointed at. A body edit would otherwise resume the dev on a
checkout standing on a commit this stage has not accounted for, and the
recovery would never be reached again on an ordinary tick: past a refusal the
issue is parked, and the human's reply is claimed by the awaiting-human branch
and spent on the dev instead of on the collapse it is about.

Owning the tick that early is what makes the park its own to answer. The
refusals this recovery takes ARE parks, and it retries them on every tick:
what the notice asks for is a branch reconciled or a comment repaired, and
what says that happened is the recovery getting further, not a reply. Nothing
is re-mentioned while one stands, so the retry costs the thread nothing.

A park the size gate worded behind it is the other kind, and that one is held
rather than re-entered: the gate posts a notice for every reading it cannot
take, so running the recovery back into it would mention a human every poll.
It waits for the reply, and the reply is then spent on the recovery rather
than on a dev resumed over a branch standing mid-rewrite.

Only the terminals sit above it, because a pull request a human merged or an
issue somebody closed is not one to rewrite for at all.

The checkout is read where it is there and rebuilt only where it is not, which
is the one thing this route may not borrow from the reviewer road. That road
ensures a worktree, and ensuring one force-removes a checkout carrying no
commits over its base -- which is exactly what a collapse rewound and not yet
recommitted looks like, with every change it was about in the index. Rebuilt
there, the staged collapse, the tree a human was asked to reconcile, and any
repair they had staged all go, and the record is left over a branch sitting on
its base. A host that lost the worktree has nothing to preserve, so one is
built and the recovery reads whichever history the remote has -- the collapse,
which it finishes, or the commits it was made from, which it squashes afresh.

The handoff a settled collapse leaves is answered beside it, and it needs no
checkout at all. A push that landed and an announcement that went out end the
claim, but the relabel behind them is a second call: failed, it leaves an
issue on `validating` whose branch is already approved, squashed, and
published, and the reviewer below would be a second review of exactly that.
The record left in the claim's place names the commit the move is owed over,
and it is acted on only while the pull request is still standing on it --
anything that moved the publication on has moved the work past the round this
record was about, and it goes rather than sending the branch on unread.
