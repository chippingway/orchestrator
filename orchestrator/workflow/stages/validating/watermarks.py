"""Where the in_review watermarks are parked when an approval hands off.

in_review wakes on "PR feedback newer than the watermark" and pings a human
that the PR is ready for merge. So the seed written here decides two ways to
be wrong: too low replays the orchestrator's own pickup ping, "PR opened",
approval, and squash notices as human feedback and resumes the dev on them;
too high advertises the PR as ready over a human comment nobody read. The
walk therefore advances only through the leading run of orchestrator-authored
comments plus the issue-thread ids a dev resume already consumed, and stops at
the first comment that is neither.

Self-authorship is decided by recorded id OR by the hidden body marker,
because either alone is wrong in a way that loses feedback: the id set is
bounded and evicts, and a login check would drop a human reviewer who shares
the PAT's account. The pickup comment is the boundary the walk starts from --
everything older is chatter the dev agent already saw at spawn -- and its
absence is answered by refusing to advance at all.

`_ratchet_watermark` closes the loop with the value already persisted: an
earlier in_review tick may have advanced past feedback the dev has since
fixed, and the seed walk deliberately stops short of it, so the two are
combined by max rather than overwritten.

    """Seed the in_review handoff watermark.

    Walk comments oldest-to-newest across both surfaces (issue thread and
    PR conversation share the IssueComment id space, so a single watermark
    covers both). The pickup comment is the boundary: everything before
    `pickup_comment_id` is pre-pickup chatter the dev agent already saw at
    spawn, so it can be advanced past. From the pickup forward, advance
    through the contiguous run of orchestrator-authored comments AND
    through any ISSUE-THREAD comment with id <= `consumed_through` (already
    fed to the dev agent via a prior `_resume_developer_on_human_reply`
    call during implementing/validating), stopping at the first
    not-yet-consumed non-orchestrator comment. This preserves human
    feedback posted during validating that the dev has not yet seen while
    NOT replaying feedback the dev has already consumed.

    `consumed_through` is intentionally NOT applied to PR-conversation
    comments. `last_action_comment_id` only records issue-thread ids fed
    via `_resume_developer_on_human_reply` (validating/implementing watch
    the issue thread only); a PR-conversation comment whose id happens to
    be <= a later-consumed issue-thread reply has NOT been seen by the dev
    and must surface on the next in_review tick. Folding both surfaces
    under one `c.id <= consumed_through` check would let the in_review
    HITL ready-ping advertise the PR as ready for human merge over unread
    PR-conversation feedback.

    Identification of orchestrator-authored content is by exact comment id
    (recorded when the orchestrator posted the comment) OR by the hidden
    body marker `_ORCH_COMMENT_MARKER` -- mirroring the in_review feedback
    filter. The id-only check would mis-treat a bot comment whose id was
    evicted from the bounded `orchestrator_comment_ids` cap (or never
    persisted due to a state-write race) as a human comment, stopping the
    walker early and stranding the watermark at a low value: the next
    in_review tick would then re-scan the same orchestrator content on
    every poll (the in_review filter still drops it via the marker, but
    the walker should not amplify that cost), and once a real human
    comment lands ABOVE the orchestrator backlog the seed walker would
    keep yielding a stale watermark indefinitely. The login-based check
    would also drop comments authored by a human reviewer who shares the
    PAT's GitHub account -- a common deployment shape -- causing real
    review feedback to be silently dropped and the PR to be pinged ready
    for human merge over it.

    Returns None when the pickup id is unknown (legacy state from a deploy
    that pre-dates pickup-id tracking, or a manually-relabeled issue) or
    when the surface has no orchestrator-authored content. The caller then
    defaults the watermark to 0 so the in_review legacy migration cannot
    advance past historical content; the orchestrator_comment_ids id-set
    filter in `_handle_in_review` drops recorded bot comments at scan time.
