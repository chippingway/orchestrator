"""One validating tick, in the order its questions have to be asked.

The terminals come first because a PR a human already merged, or an issue
closed without one, makes the whole round pointless -- and running the
reviewer against a branch that landed would pull a finished issue back into
the loop.

A squash this issue began and did not finish is answered next, ahead of every
route that can point an agent at the branch, because a branch mid-rewrite is
not one any of them may be run over. Reached only from the approval road it
survives every tick whose reviewer times out, crashes, or votes
CHANGES_REQUESTED: an already-landed collapse never gets its handoff, a record
nothing can read reaches `fixing` without the park it owes, and a body edit
resumes the dev on a checkout standing on a commit nobody accounted for. Above
the awaiting-human branch as well as the drift one, since the refusals it
takes ARE parks -- the reply to one belongs to the collapse rather than to the
dev, and a park nobody has answered yet holds the tick without being
re-mentioned every poll.

Drift comes next, ahead of the awaiting-human branch, because a body edit
mid-review means the work under review is answering the wrong requirements;
the three parks that defer back out of it are the ones whose reply belongs to
the reviewer or to the operator's round-cap command instead of to the dev.

The awaiting-human branch then either finishes the tick or clears the park
into a fresh reviewer round, which is why it answers in words rather than a
bool: `"return"` means handled, and `"spawn_reviewer"` means fall through to
the round-cap check and the spawn below.
