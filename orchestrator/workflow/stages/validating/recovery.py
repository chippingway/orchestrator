"""The parks that can clear without anyone commenting.

A push that lost a race and an agent killed by its own timeout are both
conditions the next tick can simply re-attempt, but neither produces the human
reply the awaiting-human resume waits for. Without a silent retry the issue
sits parked forever on a failure that already went away.

So the recovery runs quietly and answers in one of three words. It must not
spawn an agent or post anything -- the caller owns the visible side, so a tick
that is still stuck produces no churn at all. It IS allowed to move the review
round, and it is the only writer permitted to while the park flags are still
set: a timeout that had already committed gets its push finished here, and
that landed commit is a head the reviewer has not seen.

`push_failed` and `agent_timeout` are the two that actually touch git;
the reviewer-side reasons clear on sight, because there is no dev work to
finish, only a reviewer to re-spawn. Every probe fails closed to `"stuck"` --
a missing worktree, a dirty tree, an unreadable `pre_dev_fix_sha`, a push that
fails again -- since leaving the park standing costs a poll and publishing
blind costs the PR.

`_recovery_followup_comment` is the one sentence a healed park owes the thread,
and it is decided here because the pair it is keyed by -- the reason parked and
the word the probe answered with -- is this module's own vocabulary. Choosing
the text is all that happens: the caller that clears the flags is what posts
it, so the probe stays as quiet as its contract says and a tick that is still
stuck still says nothing at all. The mention that filed the park is what earns
the reply, so a park with no `last_action_comment_id` behind it answers None --
nothing was said, so nothing needs taking back -- and so does a reason/outcome
pair the table does not name, rather than guess at wording for it.

"At most once per episode" is answered from the thread rather than from pinned
state, because the post and the write that clears the park cannot be made one
operation: a process that dies between them leaves GitHub holding a comment
that no local record knows about, and any receipt written beside the clear
dies with it. So the follow-up carries `_RECOVERY_FOLLOWUP_MARKER` and the next
attempt looks for it among the comments past `last_action_comment_id` -- the
park's own mention id, which is what scopes the search to THIS episode, since a
later park stamps a higher watermark and cannot be silenced by an older
follow-up sitting below it. A forged marker costs its author the notification
they would have been spared anyway, which is why the cheap check is the right
one here.

    The tail both recoveries share, because the question they ask is the same
    one: a commit is sitting on this branch that the pull request does not
    carry, and what decides whether it may join it is what the pull request
    would come to with it. No developer ran on either tick, so the reading is
    taken as a reconciliation -- a head that is not the commit the record
    names is a checkout something moved, not a run's output.

    `entered_head` is the head the publication was standing on before the
    work being published was made, where the caller can name one. The timed-out
    recovery can: the run it is finishing began on a branch in sync with its
    pull request, and the anchor it left behind is that head -- so a pull
    request somebody pushed to while that run was out refuses this push
    instead of being overwritten by a commit built on the head it used to be
    on. The failed-push recovery names none, and needs none: its commit was
    already measured against a publication whose head the approval records,
    and that recorded head is what its push is pinned to.

    `candidate` is the commit the CALLER read and is publishing as, where it
    read one. The timed-out recovery does: it compares the head against the
    pre-run SHA to decide there is anything to publish at all, and between
    that reading and the proof the gate takes the worktree is writable -- so a
    commit landing in the window would be measured, pushed, and receipted as
    the work the killed run left. Named, the two are one decision and a
    checkout standing anywhere else refuses. The failed-push recovery names
    none: it read no head, and the commit it owes a push for is the one the
    approval on the record already identifies.

    The push is named and pinned by what the gate handed back, and the debt it
    pays is spent on it: an approval that outlives the publication it was
    recorded for freezes this branch out of the pre-tick base refresh with the
    recovery that would have dropped it already finished.

    The round rides that same write and is counted NOWHERE else here, which is
    what makes a recovery that runs twice count once. This tick has no run
    behind it, so the value it would compute is read off the counter itself --
    and a retry over a publication that is already settled would read a
    counter the tick which settled it has already moved. The gate is silent on
    exactly that reading, so leaving the count to it is what ties the round to
    the push that earned it rather than to the poll that noticed.

        and stays on `validating` so the reviewer reruns.
