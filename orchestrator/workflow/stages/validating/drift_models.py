"""The record a body-edit resume freezes for the helper that finishes it.

`_ValidatingDriftRun` carries the four things the finishing helper cannot read
back for itself. `worktree` is the checkout the resume actually ran in, which
need not be the one the route located before the spawn. `agent_result` is the
run the outcome is read from. `before_sha` is the HEAD taken ahead of the
agent, the only thing that tells a commit this run produced from one an
earlier tick stranded on the branch. `paused` says a live pause stopped the
resume before it persisted the session id, which is what makes the caller
return without posting, pushing, or spending a round.

The boundary against `models.py` is who reads the record. That owner answers
for the records several owners in this stage hand each other, so every
importer of it pays for all of them. This one is built and read inside the
body-edit route alone, so it stays beside that route and brings the dataclass,
path, and agent-result imports it needs along with it -- which leaves the
route's own owner importing its collaborators and nothing else.
