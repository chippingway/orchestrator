"""The records one validating tick hands between its owners.

Each carries something the owner downstream cannot re-derive. `_ReviewerRun`
holds the worktree the reviewer actually ran in and the round it ran as, so
the approval gate verifies the same checkout that was reviewed and the
feedback comment names the round the human sees on the PR. `_ReviewerDecision`
folds the parsed verdict together with the run, and its `feedback` falls back
to the agent's last message so a reviewer that put its reasoning above the
VERDICT line still reaches the dev. `_DevFixRun` carries `before_sha` -- the
pre-agent HEAD is the only thing that tells a commit this run produced from
one already on the branch -- and an optional `after_sha` for the caller that
has already read it.

`_AwaitingValidation` is the awaiting-human context: it snapshots the park
reason and the trusted comments that arrived since the last consumed one, and
its two mutators are the pair every route through that park owes -- clearing
the flags, and ratcheting `last_action_comment_id` past the comments it just
fed to an agent. Reading both once at build time is what keeps the three
decision helpers agreeing on the same batch. The orchestrator's own comments
are dropped from that batch by recorded id AND by the hidden body marker,
because every helper here reads a non-empty batch as "a human replied": a
comment this process posted and then failed to record -- the pinned write that
would have named it never landed -- is still ours, and the marker is what says
so when the id ledger cannot. `_RequestedChanges` and
`_AwaitingDevAttempt` bracket the fix that follows a verdict: the first
freezes what the CHANGES_REQUESTED route needs, the second reports whether
the resume that ran was cut short by a live pause.

`_dev_fix_run` validates rather than carries. Both fix-disposition entry
points still accept the historical positional call, so it binds one of those
calls to a `_DevFixRun` and raises on an unknown keyword rather than
swallowing a mistyped `after_sha=`.
