"""Everything an approved review still has to survive before it hands off.

The reviewer's verdict is not the last gate. The local verify run comes first
so an obviously-broken branch never reaches `in_review`, where the next reader
is a human deciding whether to merge; a default-empty `VERIFY_COMMANDS`
short-circuits to ok, and a failure parks in `validating` with a durable
reason rather than advancing. The squash follows, and its failure parks
WITHOUT relabeling on purpose -- the original commits are still on the branch,
and only a human can decide whether to keep the history or force it flat. The
notice it parks with says which of the four places the failure left the branch
in, because the errand differs: the approved commits at HEAD, the approved
commits off the tip and in the reflog behind a recorded head, the approved
commits still in the branch's own history under work committed on top of them,
or a reading that placed them nowhere at all.

The ordering inside the handoff matters too. The squash notice is posted
BEFORE `handoff` is asked to seed the watermarks, so that its own id lands in
the recorded orchestrator set and the seed walk steps past it; the reverse
order would hand in_review an informational post as fresh human PR feedback
and wake the dev on it.

A notice that was OWED and did not post is the one step that stops the
handoff, and what stops it is the record. The count that notice is worded
from lives on the pinned comment and nowhere else, so dropping it there would
put the announcement beyond every later tick; kept, the next tick's recovery
finds the collapse the remote already carries, republishes it as the leased
no-op it is, and words the notice again.

The relabel goes to `documenting`, not straight to `in_review`: the final docs
pass runs against the approved head, and everything seeded here survives that
hop. It goes LAST, behind the pinned write rather than ahead of it, because
the record of an unfinished collapse ends in that write: past the relabel the
issue belongs to a stage that never runs this recovery, so a process dying
between the two would leave a claim standing that nothing there would ever
answer -- and the watermarks the same write carries would be lost with it.

That write does not leave the boundary empty, though, because the relabel can
fail on its own. What it ends is the CLAIM; what it leaves is the commit the
move is owed over, and the route ahead of the next reviewer reads that and
moves the label rather than running a second review over a branch already
approved, squashed, and published. The record of it is dropped behind the
label, in a write of its own.

    squash call, the same notice, the same watermarks, the same write, the
    same relabel. Both roads reach it because the answer is about the BRANCH
    rather than about which reading sent them -- a recovery that finished a
    landed collapse owes the pull request exactly the announcement the tick
    that made it would have posted, and the label it never moved.

    The subject the size gate decides about, and the branch the rewrite
    lands on, are handed in rather than rebuilt: each road already holds
    every part of them, and the checkout in particular is one only that road
    may decide -- a recovery reads the worktree where it stands and rebuilds
    it only where it is absent.

    The squash is reached on every approval, whatever `SQUASH_ON_APPROVAL`
    says. The switch decides whether a NEW collapse is made and the squash
    owner asks it there: a collapse an earlier tick already made has to be
    finished either way, and an issue with nothing recorded costs an install
    with the switch off no probe, no reading, and no write.

    ends the collapse record and lands BEFORE the relabel, since past the

    owed over, so a move that does not land is the next tick's to make rather
    than the next reviewer's to re-review. And a notice this squash OWED and
    could not post stops the handoff outright: the count it is worded from
    lives on that record, so it is kept, the label stays, and the next tick
    finishes the collapse the remote already carries and announces it then.
