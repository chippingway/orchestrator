"""The records one question tick hands between its owners.

`_QuestionRun` is the tick itself, and it is the one mutable record here
because `keep_worktree` is a policy the tick revises: it opens holding whatever
the prior park implies, so a run that never reaches its disposition still tears
down (or preserves) the right tree, and the assessment overwrites it before any
park side effect can fail. Bundling the four handles also keeps the owners from
re-reading pinned state -- the session id, the usage counters, and the park all
have to land on the same `state` object the handler read at the top.

`_QuestionSession` is the locked agent identity, carried as the full configured
spec rather than a bare backend so a `DECOMPOSE_AGENT` flip between ticks cannot
retarget a conversation already in progress.

`_QuestionOutcome` is what the assessment decided without the router re-deriving
it: the park to publish, the cleanup policy it requires, and the answer or dirty
paths that park's comment quotes.
