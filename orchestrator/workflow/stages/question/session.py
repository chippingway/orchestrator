"""What keeps a multi-turn Q&A on one agent, and what it is fed each round.

A question thread can run for many ticks, and each helper here exists because
something between two rounds is allowed to change underneath it. The configured
`DECOMPOSE_AGENT` can be flipped, so the spec that actually ran is pinned and
read back rather than re-resolved. The issue thread can gain an untrusted reply,
so the consume filter drops those before they can steer the agent OR advance the
watermark. And the CLI can hand back no session id, which is why both prompt
builders sit together: the resume degrades to the full first-round prompt in
that case, because a followup handed to a fresh agent would arrive with no issue
body to answer against.
