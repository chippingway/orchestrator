"""The one bounded record a maintenance pass leaves for a candidate it decided.

Exactly one `terminal_artifact_cleanup` record per candidate the pass answered
for -- never one per phase, per artifact, or per deletion step. That
granularity is the whole of what a reader counts on: a pass takes a candidate
as one unit and answers for it once, so a count of these records is a count of
finished issues considered, and a count grouped by outcome is what the host did
about them. A record per branch would make an issue holding both published
layouts look like two, and a record per step would count a candidate whose
teardown ran further than another's as more work rather than the same one
issue.

A candidate the pass never reached has no record, exactly as it has no result:
an interrupted pass answers for the prefix it got to, and the discovery that
found the rest finds them again next interval. Nothing here is a retry list.

What may travel is closed and short: the repository and the issue the envelope
already spells, the outcome, the reason that fixes it, the layout the artifacts
were published under, and -- only where the reason is about one -- the branch.
Every one of them but the last is a member of a vocabulary this package
declares, so the record cannot say anything the code does not already name.
What a teardown actually touched stays off it: no command, no git output, no
exception text, no checkout path, nothing read out of a tree. Those belong to
the operator's `orchestrator.worktree_lifecycle` log, which is where the pass
reports each candidate in full; a sink is a metric surface, and a host's
filesystem layout is not a metric.

The branch is the one field naming an artifact, and what is published is the
name this owner derives rather than the one the result carried. Which kind of
artifact a reason is about is settled from the reason, not from the text of
the subject, because the two kinds are not distinguishable as text: under a
`WORKTREES_DIR` of `orchestrator` a checkout's path and its issue's branch are
the same characters. A checkout path therefore never becomes a branch, and
neither does anything else a result could name.

Nothing written here may change what the pass decided, and it cannot: the
records are built from results the pass has already produced and returned.
Each one rides its own boundary all the same, so a record that cannot be built
leaves every candidate behind it with its own -- a record lost is one line in a
log, while an exception let out of here would cost the answers for a whole pass
that had already run. The sink's own refusals never arrive here: it is silent
when it is turned off and it reports a filesystem that would not take the line
on its own channel.
