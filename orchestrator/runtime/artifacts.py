"""When this process reclaims the artifacts of the issues it has finished.

The pass itself belongs to `git/worktrees/`: which issues a host still holds
something for, whether each has really ended, and the commit-pinned teardown
that spends one of those readings. This owner decides only WHEN that pass may
run and what it is allowed to see while it does.

It runs between polling passes rather than inside a tick, and that is the whole
reason this module exists. A tick is per-repository, concurrent with the other
repositories' ticks, and full of workers it has just handed to the scheduler;
the thing being reclaimed is one host's disk and one remote's refs, shared by
every repository on it. Nothing inside a tick can say the host is quiet,
because a tick is what makes it busy.

So the pass runs under a scheduler barrier: admission is closed for counted
workers and tracked claims alike, the work already admitted is waited out
within a finite bound, and only a host that went quiet is acted on. Anything
else -- the bound expiring, a shutdown starting, the barrier declining to be
taken at all -- defers the whole pass, which costs a day of one finished
issue's checkout and nothing else. Admission always reopens, because the hold
is given back around the body whatever the body did. The pass keeps its own
per-candidate claim check underneath all of that: this barrier is what makes
the answer worth having, and that check is what makes a wrong answer harmless.

A hold is a snapshot, and a signal can land the line after it was granted, so
the grant is not the last word: whether this process may still act is asked
again before every candidate, from the run's own stop flag and from the
scheduler that granted the hold. A pass interrupted between two candidates
leaves the rest where they are.

What the barrier cannot say anything about is another PROCESS, since its
counters and claims are this one's own. That is `exclusion`'s: the host is
claimed exclusively for as long as any pass acts, by the one-shot mode on the
way in and by a polling run handing its own presence over. A pass refused the
host does nothing, and a poller that wants the host back waits -- which is why
this module bounds how long a pass may hold it, and gives it back at a
candidate boundary with whatever is left over owed to the next interval.

The two are nested in the one order that is safe, and this module is where that
order lives. The barrier is OUTSIDE: a polling run's presence is what keeps
every other process off these artifacts, so it may only be handed over from a
process that has already gone quiet, and it has to be back before admission
reopens. Dropping it first would publish the host while this run still had a
worker mid-agent-run -- and a process that took it then would sweep with its
own empty scheduler as its only evidence, which is exactly the reading nothing
here may act on.

How often is `TERMINAL_ARTIFACT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, kept by a gate this
run holds in memory. Nothing is persisted, so a restart may spend one extra
pass -- which is a pass that reads the host again and reports whatever is
already gone as done.

What a pass DID is reported here and in `artifact_records` beside it, and
nowhere else: one log line per candidate and the tally over them, then one
bounded record per candidate on the analytics sink. Both are taken from the
answers the pass has already produced, so neither can reach a decision, and the
records are handed over per candidate so a refused sink costs one line rather
than the rest of them.
