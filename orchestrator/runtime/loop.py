"""How many polling passes a run makes, and the drain it always ends with.

`--once` is a single pass; otherwise the run keeps polling until a signal stops
it or the checkout it runs from moves under it, which exits 0 so the wrapper
relaunches the new code. Either way the body runs inside `scheduler_drained`,
so the workers a pass submitted are waited on even when the pass raised, and
the drain sets the event the shutdown watchdog is waiting on.

The recurring form is also where the host-wide artifact maintenance is fitted
in: at the END of the wait between two passes, behind a due gate this loop
holds for the run. There, because the pass needs the scheduler quiet and a tick
is what makes it busy -- the far end of the interval is the quietest moment
this loop has, where the short handlers the last pass submitted have had the
whole wait to finish. Behind a gate, because the pass is owed once an interval
and this loop comes round once a poll. `--once` is a single tick and nothing
besides -- an operator asking for one pass gets one pass, and the
maintenance-only launch mode is where a host asks for the reclamation on its
own.
