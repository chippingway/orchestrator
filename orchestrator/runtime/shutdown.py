"""Signal handling, watchdog timing, and forced-exit cleanup.

The cooperative half only advances at tick boundaries, so every stop is also
armed with a daemon watchdog: if the drain overruns, in-flight process groups
are terminated and the process hard-exits, which keeps signal-to-exit inside
`SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS` no matter what a worker is blocked on. The sweep the
watchdog ends with takes time of its own, so it is reserved out of that budget
rather than added on top of it.

The handler is bound to the run's state, and the first signal re-arms the
kernel default, so a second Ctrl+C kills immediately instead of queueing
behind the drain.
