"""What one polling run is built from before its first tick.

The options an operator started it with, one authenticated client per
configured repository, and the single scheduler every tick hands work to. Each
of them reads the configuration inside its own call, so a run reflects the
environment it was started in rather than the one this module was imported in.

`RepoClients` is what both connects hand back and what every pass over the
repositories is typed by: the spec stays paired with the client built for it,
because the pairing is what a tick would otherwise have to reconstruct.

There are two connects because there are two things a run can be started for.
The polling one bootstraps each repository's labels, since a tick is about to
write them; the read-only one writes nothing at all, which is what makes it
usable by a launch mode whose whole contract is that it touches no workflow
state on GitHub.
