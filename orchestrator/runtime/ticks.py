"""One polling pass over the configured repositories.

A pass is where the run's own stop flag is honoured: a repository whose turn
comes after a signal is skipped rather than started, and a repository whose
tick raises is logged and left behind so the others still advance. The
completion drain and the analytics prune run once at the end of the pass,
never once per repository -- both are process-wide.
