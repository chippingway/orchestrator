"""The concrete ``IssueScheduler`` and the layers it is built from.

The scheduler's responsibilities are split across four layers that only this
module composes: read-only state inspection plus temporary claims, atomic slot
admission and release, the reversible barrier that closes both admission paths
and waits the admitted work out, and worker dispatch with completion draining.
Callers reach the composed ``IssueScheduler`` through the package API.

What a refused submission MEANT is not one of them. A submission this
scheduler declines costs its caller a turn, and the caller decides what that
is worth -- a cleanup refused because a worker already holds the issue costs
an observation instead, and the workflow keeps that reading somewhere its own
stage handlers can reach it rather than here, where nothing above the slot
accounting could.

The one thing this scheduler answers about the whole host rather than about one
submission is whether it has gone quiet, and it answers it only while holding
admission closed: a caller that has to act on the absence of work needs the
absence to still be true one line later. What such a caller then DOES under
that hold is not one of the responsibilities either.
