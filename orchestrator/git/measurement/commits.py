"""The two commits a size measurement is taken between, each proven first.

Both ends are object ids this owner establishes, never refs the count is left
to resolve for itself, because everything the number is used for outlives the
tick that took it. The candidate is adjudicated over several ticks and a
restart, so a reading of `HEAD` here and a diff of `HEAD` a moment later are
answers about two different commits the instant anything moves the branch. The
base is worse than moving: `refs/remotes/<remote>/<base>` names the base but
lives in the object store the issue's own worktree shares, so an agent that
commits its code, repoints that ref at its own commit, and commits again leaves
a base-relative diff measuring its work against itself. What the REMOTE says
the branch is at is the one answer nothing on this host can rewrite.

Proving is a separate step from naming for the same reason it is elsewhere in
this package: a diff that names a commit git cannot resolve FAILS, and a failed
read is a candidate with no size rather than a small one. The two ends prove it
differently. The remote's tip is routinely an id this clone has not fetched yet
-- the base moves on its own between the tick's fetch and the measurement
minutes later -- so the object is fetched and re-asked for, and only an id the
store really holds is handed back. The candidate is peeled instead: an id that
will not peel to a commit is one this host does not have, which is work made
somewhere else and nothing here may substitute a newer HEAD for it, and an id
that peels to a DIFFERENT one was a label on the work rather than the work.

    """Resolve `revision` to the one commit id a measurement may name.

    Two questions, because they fail differently and a caller has to tell them
    apart. Resolving is the first: `--verify` makes git answer with exactly one
    id or with nothing, so a branch name that no longer exists, a detached
    checkout with no commit on it, or a hand-edited revision comes back as a
    reading that established nothing instead of as a list a caller would take
    the first line of. `--end-of-options` keeps a revision that begins with a
    dash from being read as a flag.

    Being a commit this repository holds is the second, and it is asked by
    peeling rather than by looking the id up as it stands. Two answers come out
    of that one step. An id whose object is missing cannot be peeled, which is
    the reading a SHA recorded on another host produces: git resolves a full
    object id to itself whether or not this repository has ever seen it, so it
    comes back from the first step looking exactly like a commit that is here,
    and the diff that would spend it fails -- reporting no paths and no lines,
    which is what a candidate that changes nothing reports too. And an id that
    IS here but is not a commit -- an annotated tag, whose own object is a tag
    pointing at one -- peels to the commit it names, so what gets recorded is
    the work rather than the label somebody put on it. A record naming a tag
    object would be evidence about the wrong kind of thing: nothing downstream
    could compare it to a branch tip, and the tag can be moved or deleted while
    the commit cannot.

    Hardened for the reason every read of an agent-writable worktree is, and
    for one that is specific to naming commits by id: `refs/replace/<oid>` and
    the graft file both make git serve one commit under another's name, and
    both are writable from the worktree the agent runs in. The hardened
    envelope turns object replacement off, so the id proved here is the commit
    that will be measured and published rather than a stand-in for it.
