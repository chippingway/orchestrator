"""How many lines a candidate adds over its base, counted across every path.

The count is the prospective pull request's own diff -- the frozen base
against the exact candidate commit, three-dot, so a base that moved on since
the branch forked is not read as work this branch did -- and it is deliberately
the plainest reading of it there is. Every path counts. There is no exemption
for a lockfile, generated code, a migration, a snapshot, a golden fixture, an
i18n catalog, a notebook, a vendored tree, a mass move, or a mass reformat: an
exemption list is a bypass anybody can move work into, and the number is only
worth adjudicating if a reader can reproduce it from the diff in front of them.

Two of the readings that follow from that are git's to make rather than this
owner's. Binary content has no lines in it to add, so git reports `-` for the
path and it totals nothing. And a move is not one event here: `--no-renames`
is passed, so a relocated file is reported as the deletion and the addition it
literally is, and the content that arrived at its new path counts like content
arriving anywhere else. With rename detection on it would cost nothing at all,
which is a candidate made to measure small by moving into place what it was
going to write anyway.

Which paths have lines at all -- and how many lines they come to -- is decided
by inputs the agent can write, so the reading is pinned to the commit rather
than to the checkout it is taken in. The algorithm is part of that: git's
algorithms pair a change with repeated lines in it differently, and the same
two commits count 4 additions per path under `myers` and 7 under `histogram`,
so a count left to `diff.algorithm` is one a `git config` beside the work can
retune the ceiling from below. By
default git resolves `.gitattributes` out of the WORKING TREE, so an
uncommitted `* -diff` beside the work has every path report as binary and a
candidate of any size measure as zero -- while the pull request a human then
reads shows the text in full. The attribute source is therefore pinned to the
candidate's own tree -- in the ENVIRONMENT, since `GIT_ATTR_SOURCE` outranks
the config a `-c` would set and an inherited one would otherwise name any tree
it liked -- the user and system attribute files are taken out of the reading,
and the size above which git stops looking for lines is restated at its default
so a `core.bigFileThreshold` planted in the shared repository cannot lower it. A
`.gitattributes` the candidate COMMITS is left to speak: it is part of what is
being measured and part of what a reviewer sees.

Two inputs are outside all of that, and a measurement refuses rather than
reports when either is present. `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes` is not config, so no
override on the command line reaches it, and it outranks the pinned tree. A
diff driver defined in the repository's own config can declare a path binary
once anything assigns it. Both live where the agent works, and neither can be
neutralized from here.

A reading that could not be taken is never a small candidate. A diff that
failed and a record this build cannot account for are both typed failures with
no number beside them, because what a failed `git diff` writes to stdout is
nothing -- the same thing a candidate that changes nothing writes -- and
publishing on that reading is how an unadjudicated implementation goes out.
