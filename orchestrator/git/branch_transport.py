"""Token-bearing branch fetches and the branch push, run under a credential session.

The two fetches and the push share this module because they are one transport
read at branch level: each resolves a token through `credentials`, opens a
session around it, and spawns git with the environment that session built and
an argv naming nothing but the `x-access-token` URL. What the token stays out
of is that argv -- git reads it from `$GIT_TOKEN` through the askpass script
instead, so it never reaches the world-readable `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. The
session carries it here because this module needs it for the one thing the
environment cannot do: scrubbing it back out of the stderr a failed call is
logged with, and out of the stderr a fetch hands its caller -- what a caller
carries into a record and reports somewhere else has to be as safe to print as
what this module logs.

What a branch is at on the remote is asked through `ref_transport` beside this
one, which owns every remote read and write named by a whole refname. The lease
is where the two part: a branch push may look the remote up for itself, because
a branch is a moving thing whose current tip is the honest expectation, while a
ref update there states what the caller established was there and has no form
that overwrites whatever it finds.

    `_push_branch`.

    Used for fetches from inside an agent-writable worktree where any
    of the following vectors could leak GIT_TOKEN to an attacker host:
      * a planted credential helper in the worktree's `.git/config`,
      * a planted `core.hooksPath` / `core.fsmonitor` that runs an
        attacker-controlled binary with GIT_TOKEN in env,
      * a planted `url.<host>.insteadOf` rewrite in the worktree's
        local config OR in `~/.gitconfig` redirecting fetch to an
        attacker-controlled host,
      * a planted `http.proxy` / `http.sslVerify=false` (or other
        `http.*` TLS/proxy key) in the worktree's local config routing
        the token-bearing fetch through an attacker proxy or disabling
        certificate verification.

    The auth URL carries only the username (`x-access-token`); the
    token itself is read from $GIT_TOKEN by a tempfile askpass script
    so it never appears in argv. Global/system git config is detached
    via `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` / `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null`
    so url-rewrite rules planted there cannot apply. We also refuse to
    run if the worktree's local config carries any url-rewrite rule or
    `http.*` transport setting (`_unsafe_local_transport_config`),
    mirroring `_push_branch`'s pre-flight check.

    `refspec` is the fetch refspec; pass an explicit form like
    `+refs/heads/<branch>:refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` so single-branch
    clones still update the remote-tracking ref instead of leaving the
    fetched payload only in FETCH_HEAD.

    The fetch updates the parent clone's `refs/remotes/<remote>/...`
    namespace from inside an agent-writable worktree, which means it
    grabs the parent's ref-update lock under `<git-dir>/packed-refs.lock`
    and `<git-dir>/refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>.lock`. Two concurrent
    `_authed_fetch` calls from different worktrees of the same
    `target_root` (the common shape during fan-out of multiple
    `resolving_conflict` issues) race those lock files and one fails
    with `Unable to create '...': File exists.`, parking the issue.
    The actual subprocess call is therefore held under the
    per-target_root lock; the pre-flight URL-rewrite check stays
    outside the lock since it only reads the worktree's own
    `.git/config`.

    `_ensure_decompose_worktree`) and the per-tick base refresh
    (`_refresh_base_and_worktrees`) used to run. The plain form relied on
    git's ambient credential helper or session state, which fails under
    systemd (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` disables the fallback prompt) and
    has no way to pick a per-repo token when the local clone has several
    GitHub-pointing remotes whose `slug` differs from the
    `~/.config/<owner>/<repo>/token` of the configured `REPO`.

    The `spec.remote_name` field selects the local remote namespace --
    refs land under `refs/remotes/<spec.remote_name>/<branch>` -- while
    `spec.slug` selects which GitHub repo / token to authenticate with.
    Without this split, a `REPOS` row like
    `geserdugarov/lance-private|...|private-cache|private` would try to
    use the cached single-repo `config.GITHUB_TOKEN` (looked up once for
    `config.REPO`) and fail to fetch even with a correct per-spec token
    file in place.

    remote-tracking ref instead of leaving the fetched payload only in
    FETCH_HEAD -- the worktree creators then anchor `git worktree add`
    on `<remote>/<branch>` without surprise.

    Same security envelope as `_push_branch` / `_authed_fetch`: token
    delivered via GIT_ASKPASS (never argv), global/system git config
    detached so url-rewrite rules planted in `~/.gitconfig` cannot
    redirect the fetch to an attacker-controlled host, hooks /
    fsmonitor / credential helpers blocked via `-c` overrides. The
    target_root is normally operator-owned, but a linked worktree
    (which the agent does write) can still mutate the parent clone's
    local config via `git config --local`, and local config still
    applies even with GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM detached. Mirror the
    `_authed_fetch` / `_push_branch` pre-flight refusal: bail out if
    `target_root`'s local config carries any
    `url.<host>.(insteadOf|pushInsteadOf)` rule or `http.*` proxy/TLS
    setting that could redirect the token-bearing fetch to an
    attacker-controlled host or strip TLS verification
    (`_unsafe_local_transport_config`).

    """Push via GIT_ASKPASS so the token never appears in argv.

    `revision`, when provided, is the exact commit to publish, and it exists
    for every caller that decided to push by INSPECTING one. Nearly all of
    them do. The `discussion` stage's plan publication reads a branch and
    proves it carries the agreed plan and nothing else; the `implementing`
    stage's publication decides on one commit ahead of the push -- the one the
    size gate measured or an adjudication accepted, or the one the checkout is
    standing on where the gate proved none -- and names the push, the receipt
    it records, and the proof it takes once the pull request is open against
    that same commit. Every push onto a pull request the remote ALREADY
    carries names one too, and for the same reason: the size gate measures
    before each of them and hands back the commit it measured -- the dev-fix
    publication and the bounce behind it, both validating recoveries, the
    three conflict publications, the base sync's auto-rebase and its crash
    recovery, and the final docs pass.
    `HEAD` between the reading and the push is not necessarily what was proven
    -- another tick, an operator, or a stray agent can move it -- and pushing
    whatever HEAD says would publish work no check ever saw while the record
    named the commit that passed. Naming the SHA closes that window in the
    only place it can be closed: a revision the local repo no longer has is
    refused by git rather than substituted.

    The two initial publications have no fallback here, which is a fact about
    them rather than about this helper: a checkout that cannot name the commit
    it is on is refused by its own caller before this is reached, because a
    push named against nothing would send whatever the branch had become and
    leave the receipt and both proofs with no commit to compare against.

    What reaches this function with no `revision` is one push and only one: a
    gated one on an install running with `DECOMPOSE=off` whose checkout would
    not prove its own head. The switch keeps candidates out of the
    MEASUREMENT rather than out of a push that knows what it is publishing, so
    the commit is named off the checkout there too -- only a reading that
    failed outright falls through, publishing whatever the worktree currently
    is with the receipt and the post-push proof skipped, since neither has a
    commit to be about.

    `force_with_lease`, when provided, is the SHA the caller expects the
    remote ref to be at. The push then uses
    `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<sha>` against that exact SHA,
    so a concurrent update to the remote rejects the push instead of being
    silently clobbered, and no `ls-remote` of our own is taken. Any caller
    that DECIDED to push by reading the remote belongs on this path: the
    squash/rewrite, which pins the pre-rewrite HEAD it approved; the
    `discussion` stage's plan publication, which pins the tip it
    established the branch was safe to move; the conflict and base-sync
    publications, each pinning the SHA it read for itself -- the pre-rebase
    head, or the pull-request head it validated as this orchestrator's own;
    and every push the size gate let through, which pins the head the pull
    request was standing on when the reading was taken, so a pull request
    somebody pushed to since rejects work measured against the head it used
    to be on.
    Pinning is what prevents the
    "out-of-band update happened in the window between the reading and the
    push" race -- a fresh `ls-remote` would treat the unexpected new remote
    SHA as the lease value and silently overwrite it, which for a
    publication being retried after a crash means overwriting whoever
    pushed to the branch in between.

    When `force_with_lease` is None (the default), the function reads the
    current remote SHA via `ls-remote` and uses that as the lease. This is
    the normal-push path: the orchestrator owns the
    `orchestrator/<slug>/issue-<n>` namespace, but a self-restart between commit
    and push can leave the worktree on a different SHA than what was
    already pushed -- e.g. a `resume=False` rerun of codex amending
    equivalent work. A plain push then fails non-fast-forward and parks
    the issue. The lease lets the retry succeed while still refusing to
    clobber a concurrent foreign update (the lease check compares against
    what we observed, not a stale remote-tracking ref).

    The push target URL carries only the username (`x-access-token`); the
    token itself is read from the GIT_TOKEN env var by a tempfile askpass
    script. This keeps the PAT out of `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which is
    world-readable on Linux. The refspec is explicit either way -- so no
    upstream is set and no remote URL is stored in .git/config -- and which
    one it is follows `revision`: `<revision>:refs/heads/<branch>` where a
    caller named the commit it means, and `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>` where
    none did.

    The worktree is shared with the codex agent, so anything in `.git/hooks/`
    or `.git/config` is attacker-controlled. The agent also writes as the same
    OS user, so it can plant `~/.gitconfig` (or anything pointed at by
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME) before we push. We harden the push so a planted pre-push
    hook, credential helper, fsmonitor, url-rewrite rule, or http proxy /
    TLS override cannot observe GIT_TOKEN or redirect the push to an
    attacker-controlled host:
      * `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` disables `.git/hooks/*` and any hooksPath
        override the agent set in the local config.
      * `credential.helper=` (empty) clears all inherited credential helpers
        so a repo-local helper script never executes with GIT_TOKEN in env.
      * `core.fsmonitor=` disables any fsmonitor program git would otherwise
        spawn for index-touching operations.
      * `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` block
        global/system config entirely, so url.<host>.insteadOf or
        pushInsteadOf rules planted in `~/.gitconfig` (or `/etc/gitconfig`)
        cannot rewrite our auth URL and exfiltrate the askpass token.
      * We also refuse to push if the local config contains any url
        insteadOf/pushInsteadOf rewrite or any `http.*` transport setting
        (`_unsafe_local_transport_config`). A rewrite redelivers the token
        to whatever host the agent picked; a local `http.proxy` /
        `http.sslVerify=false` (or URL-scoped `http.<url>.*` variant, which a
        command-line `-c http.proxy=` override cannot beat) would tunnel the
        token-bearing push through an attacker proxy or disable TLS
        verification. Env-var proxies (`https_proxy`) are operator-set and
        stay honored -- only agent-writable config-file transport is rejected.
