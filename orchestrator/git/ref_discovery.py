"""What a remote carries under a pattern, over the authenticated transport.

The one question about a remote that starts from no name at all. Every read
the transport beside this owns is asked about a refname somebody already has --
a branch the clone still carries, a snapshot ref a record names -- so a branch
whose local ref was deleted, or whose whole clone was rebuilt, is invisible to
all of them while the remote still carries it. This asks the remote what it
holds under a namespace and gets those names back, which is the only way an
artifact this host no longer names is found.

Its own owner because nothing is pinned to what it says. A single-ref read is
half of a lease -- the caller states the reading back as the value its write
must still find -- and the writes that spend one sit beside it for that reason.
A listing pins nothing: it opens the question of which artifacts exist, and
every decision about one of them is taken afterwards, by a caller that has to
establish each name on its own.

The read is asked of the remote rather than of the local ref store for the
reason every read here is: the object store a worktree shares is writable by
the agent running in it, so a local ref that looks like the answer proves
nothing, while the remote's own answer is the one nothing on this host can
rewrite.

The call runs under the whole token-bearing envelope: a token resolved per
repository through `credentials`, an askpass session that keeps it out of the
world-readable `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, global and system config detached, hooks,
credential helpers, and fsmonitor disabled by `-c`, and a refusal when the
worktree's local config carries a url rewrite or an `http.*` setting that could
redirect the call to an attacker-controlled host. The session carries the token
back here for the one thing the environment cannot do: scrubbing it out of the
stderr a failed listing is logged with.

Which namespace is asked about, and what a name found there means, belongs to
the caller. The artifact discovery under `git/worktrees/` owns the
orchestrator's own branch namespace and is what spends this listing, on the
half of its scan the host cannot answer.

    `--refs` is asked for so a tag's peeled entry cannot arrive as a refname

    which is the safe direction for the one thing this listing is spent on: a
