"""Plain and hardened git execution plus local transport probing.

The argv prefixes live here because every git invocation is assembled from
them: the hardened prefix extends the authenticated one that the
token-bearing fetch and push leaves run under, so the two cannot drift.

Output is decoded with `surrogateescape` rather than strictly. A repository
path is bytes on this platform, and git hands back exactly the bytes it has --
so a committed file whose name is not valid UTF-8 makes a strict decode raise
inside `subprocess` itself, before any caller can read a return code. What that
costs is the whole point: the probes reading these paths are the ones that
refuse to publish a branch carrying anything unexpected, and a raise there
takes the tick out rather than parking the artifact that caused it. Decoded
with surrogates, such a path comes back as a path -- unequal to whatever the
caller permitted, which is the answer it was asking for.

The hardened runner also has an undecoded form, because decoding at all is
more than one kind of caller can afford: text capture folds a CR LF pair and a
lone CR into a single LF, which is lossy about a path and therefore about
anything hashed over one. A caller taking a digest spends
`_git_hardened_bytes` and hashes exactly what git wrote; every other caller
reads the text. Where what git writes is an agent-sized amount of content
rather than a listing of it, `_git_hardened_streamed` takes the request on
stdin and hands the answer over a chunk at a time, assembling none of it.

    the worktree's `.git/config` (or in `~/.gitconfig`) would otherwise
    execute attacker code mid-operation or redirect a transient fetch to an
    attacker-controlled host, and a planted replacement object or graft would
    have git answer for a commit nobody wrote. Drops global/system git config so url
    `insteadOf` rewrites and host-wide hooks cannot apply, and disables
    repo-local hooks / fsmonitor / credential helpers / commit signing via
    `-c` overrides. No askpass is wired in -- this helper is for local-only
    operations (rebase, diff, rev-parse); push remains the only call site
    that handles GIT_TOKEN.

    Injects `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars (matching the
    agent spawn's `agent_env`) so a `git rebase` that needs to replay
    commits doesn't fail with "Committer identity unknown" -- stripping
    global config also strips any `user.name` / `user.email` set there,
    and env vars take precedence over config.

    Object replacement is turned off for the same reason the config is
    detached, and it is the sharper of the two: an agent that writes
    `refs/replace/<commit>` or a line in `info/grafts` changes what git says a
    commit's tree and history ARE, without touching the commit anybody named.
    A check that reads a branch here and a push that sends the same SHA would
    then be talking about two different things -- the reading measured against
    a synthetic stand-in, the push carrying the real commits. Refs and the
    graft file are not config, so nothing above disables them; the two env
    vars here do.

    `env_extra` is applied last, over both the process environment and the
    hardening above, and exists for what git reads from the environment rather
    than from config -- where a `-c` on the command line does not win. A caller
    that has to PIN one of those (which tree `.gitattributes` are read from,
    whether the system-wide ones are consulted at all) states it here, so what
    this process happened to inherit cannot answer for it instead.
