"""The three teardown steps a maintenance pass spends a proof on.

Every step here is pinned to a commit somebody established, and every one of
them is refused by git itself when what it finds is not that commit. That is
the whole difference between this owner and the best-effort teardown in
``cleanup``: a stage handler tearing down the issue it has just driven knows
what the artifacts are, and a stale ref there is tidiness. A maintenance pass
knows only what a reading told it some seconds ago, and between the reading and
the mutation an agent can commit, a human can push, and a checkout can be
written in -- so what it deletes has to be the thing that was proved and
nothing else.

The pinning is git's, not this module's, which is what makes it hold against a
race rather than merely against a slow reader:

* the checkout is removed WITHOUT `--force`, so git's own refusal over a
  modified or untracked tree stands between the proof and the deletion;
* the remote branch goes under a lease naming the proven commit, so a branch
  pushed since is refused by the remote rather than overwritten here;
* the local ref goes through `update-ref -d` with the proven commit as its
  expected value, so a branch an agent committed onto is refused by the ref
  store -- and with `--no-deref`, so a symbolic ref of that name is deleted as
  itself rather than followed to whatever it points at.

Nothing here decides WHETHER a step should run, in what order, or what a
failure costs: that is ``maintenance``'s, which is also the only caller. Each
step answers a single bool -- whether the artifact is now gone -- and an
absence is that answer too, so a pass repeating over a teardown that half
finished takes the rest of it and reports the part already done as done.

    reading of the tree is backed by git's at the moment of the deletion --
    the one reading a race cannot get in front of. What git does NOT refuse
    over is a path the repository's own ignore rules cover, which is why the
    classification asks about those separately and keeps the candidate itself.
