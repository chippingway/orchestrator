"""Which configured repository a checkout directory belongs to, if it settles.

Every repository's checkouts hang off one `WORKTREES_DIR`, whatever clone the
repository is on, so a directory cannot be attributed the way a branch is:
what the name says is not enough on its own. Two shapes reach this owner, and
both take the whole set of configured specs for that reason.

The flat pre-namespacing checkout, `WORKTREES_DIR/issue-<n>`, carries no slug
at all -- every configured entry derived it identically -- so the repository
the directory is OF settles it instead: the git directory the checkout and its
clone share, which is the same identity the classification tests a named
checkout by. That answers every host whose entries keep their own clones and
leaves exactly one case open, which is the case a shared ref store leaves open
for a branch too: two entries on one clone.

The per-repository checkout directory is the same ambiguity one derivation
over. The path sanitizer that names it is lossy, so two entries whose slugs
differ only in a character it rewrites are handed one directory to keep their
checkouts in, and an `issue-<n>` in it names an issue in whichever of them
created it.

Both fail closed, and they cost more to get wrong than the branch rules in
``attribution`` do. A checkout is a live worktree standing on one of that
issue's branches, so an unsettled claim names its claimants rather than
nobody: a caller has to withhold the whole issue -- the branches beside the
tree included -- because reporting a branch whose tree nobody may remove hands
a teardown a ref to delete under a checkout that is still holding it.

    configured entry produced, identically. What settles it instead is the same

    the checkout whose own clone could not be read, which claims every entry
    there is.

    An owner therefore comes back only where the whole question was answered:
    one claimant, and that claimant's clone read and matched. Every other shape
