"""The bounded pass that spends a classification on a finished issue's artifacts.

The one place in this domain that deletes something nobody asked it to delete.
Everything under it is a reading -- the discovery in ``discovery``, the
classification in ``eligibility``, the fail-closed probes in ``evidence`` and
``claims`` -- and this module is where those readings are turned into three
mutations and one answer per candidate.

What it does NOT touch is as much of its contract as what it does. No workflow
label is written, no pinned state, no comment, and no agent session is started
or stopped: an issue that has ended keeps every record of how it ended, and a
host tidying its own disk must not be able to change what GitHub says happened.
The artifacts are the whole of what this pass owns.

Every gate in front of the mutation fails closed, and they are asked cheapest
first. Whether something is running for this issue right now is asked of an
injected guard, because the answer lives in the process the pass runs beside --
the scheduler holding a claim, a worker mid-tick -- and this layer may not
reach up into the workflow to find it. Then the classification, which is where
the issue's own ending, the pull requests still standing on the branches, and
every reading of the artifacts are established. Then, last and only for a
candidate everything else cleared, whether the checkout has been touched
lately: a tree nobody proved is not one whose modification time says anything.

The mutations are ordered by what git allows and by what a failed pass has to
leave behind. The checkout goes first because a branch checked out somewhere
cannot be deleted. Each branch is then taken on the remote before the clone,
so a remote delete that fails leaves the local ref standing -- and a local ref
is what makes the candidate discoverable again, where a remote-only artifact
would be found only by the next listing of the remote. A pass that stops leaves
everything it had not reached exactly where it was; nothing is written down,
because the discovery that found the candidate once finds what is left of it
again. That is what makes an interrupted pass cost nothing to resume and a
repeated one report the parts already gone as done.
