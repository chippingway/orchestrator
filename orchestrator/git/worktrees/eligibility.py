"""Which discovered artifacts may be reclaimed, and why the rest are kept.

The classifier over what the scan in ``inventory`` found. It reads and
decides and does nothing else: no label is written, no comment posted, no ref
created, moved, or fetched, on this host or on the remote. A verdict is safe
to take at any point in a tick and safe to throw away, which is what lets the
pass that acts on one be a separate decision from the pass that reaches it.

The order the questions are put in is the order they can settle the answer
in, cheapest claim first. Whether the issue ended at all comes before
anything about the artifacts, because an issue still running keeps its
checkout whatever state the tree is in. An open pull request comes next, and
it is a claim rather than a state: a human reviewing a branch is standing on
it, and the issue underneath having ended does not move them off it. Only
then are the artifacts themselves read, through ``evidence``.

What "eligible" means here is narrow on purpose: every artifact this scan
reported for this issue may be deleted without taking anything with it. The
checkout has to be this issue's own and carrying nothing loose, and every
commit an artifact is holding -- a branch's tip, and the one the checkout's
own HEAD stands on -- has to exist somewhere that outlives it: inside the
configured base, or inside a pull request that has ended. One proof serves
both, so the three shapes a scan can report one issue in reach one verdict
rather than three.

The remote is asked about the branch whatever the base says, because the two
answer different questions: the base says whether the commit survives being
deleted, and the remote says whether the branch this host holds is still the
branch the remote has. A tip already merged can sit under a branch somebody
has since pushed past.

A commit nobody can say where it went is kept, and so is every question that
could not be put: they are all one answer to a caller that only asks whether
it may delete, and that answer has to be no.

What an eligible verdict hands back is the commits it cleared, not only the
permission. The proof is about an object id and the artifact standing on it,
so the teardown that spends the verdict can tell the branch that was cleared
from the branch of that name it finds when it gets there. Every artifact this
scan reported gets one, the branch that has since been deleted from this clone
included: the remote may still carry that branch, and a copy nobody proved is
a copy the teardown may neither delete nor write down.

    A checkout is an artifact that HOLDS something rather than a directory

    its own, and when no ref points at the commit that HEAD names, those two
    are the only things keeping it reachable -- so removing the checkout is
    what takes the commit, and the proof a branch owes is owed here too.

    A commit one of this issue's reported branches is standing on needs
    nothing further: that branch is proven on its own terms, and whichever way
    its verdict goes the checkout is not the only thing holding the commit.
    Equality is the whole of that test -- a HEAD somewhere further back in a
    branch's history is not something this establishes cheaply, and it fails
    closed.

    A HEAD that names no commit is the shape this exists for, and it is
    reported as a checkout nothing could be established about. `update-ref -d`
    removes a branch a live checkout is on, and afterwards every other reading
    comes back unchanged: the symbolic ref still spells this issue's branch,
    and a tree whose commits went with it still reports clean. That read is
    handed in rather than taken here, because the commit it resolves is also
    what an eligible verdict has to hand over -- one reading, spent twice.

    What is left runs the proof a branch runs, on the branch HEAD is on. The
    commit is a branch tip whichever artifact the report names it through, so
