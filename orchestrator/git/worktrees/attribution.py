"""Which configured repository a local branch belongs to, and which issue.

A branch found in this host's orchestrator-owned namespace is not evidence of
anything on its own. Several ``REPOS`` entries may share one `target_root` --
a public and a private remote over a single checkout is the shape branch
namespacing exists for -- and their ref stores are one store, so everything
under `orchestrator/` there was published by whichever of them owns that
issue. Attribution is therefore a question about the whole set of configured
specs rather than about one name in isolation, and every function here takes
that set.

Two rules, both exact and both failing closed:

* A name is attributed only when a spec's own derivation in ``paths``
  produces it character for character. Nothing is parsed back into a slug, so
  a segment no configured entry writes, an extra path component, or a padded
  number is left alone rather than reconstructed into a repository.
* A name several specs could equally own is attributed to none of them. The
  legacy flat layout carries no slug at all, which makes every spec on a
  shared clone an equal claimant to `orchestrator/issue-<n>`.

The refusal costs one thing -- a branch this scan will not report -- and the
alternative costs more: a branch attributed to the wrong repository is one a
caller acts on against the wrong GitHub issue.

The checkouts those branches are standing in ask the same question of a name
that carries even less, and ``checkout_attribution`` answers it: the flat
directory every entry derived identically, and the per-repository parent a
lossy sanitizer can hand to two of them.
