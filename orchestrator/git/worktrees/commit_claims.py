"""Whether a terminal pull request already published a branch tip.

The second way a commit the base does not contain can still be safe to
delete. The first is the base itself; this is the pull request the commit went
out on and a human then closed without merging -- rejected work is still
published work, and the branch is a local copy of something GitHub has.

A different question from the ones the ``claims`` sibling puts. Those are
about the issue -- whether it ended, and whether anybody is still standing on
the branches it was published under -- and either settles a candidate before
any artifact is read. This one is about a single object id, and it is asked
last, once the base has been asked and had nothing to say: not whether the
work is finished, but whether deleting this commit loses it.

Exact, and it is the commit that makes it so. The lookup is by object id
rather than by branch name, so a pull request that once used this branch for
some earlier round does not account for what is on it now.

No base is named, for the same reason the open-pull-request claim names none:
what makes the commit safe to delete is that GitHub holds it, and a pull
request retargeted onto another base holds it exactly as well. Filtered by the
configured base, that publication would read as no publication at all and the
branch carrying it would be reclaimed.

The read is behind its own boundary, and the boundary produces a retention
rather than a raise or a default. A lookup that failed is not "no pull
request": read that way round, the reclamation deletes an unpublished branch
on the strength of a question nobody could put.

    that reclaims.

    Three answers, and only one of them does. A lookup that could not be taken
    is retained on rather than read as "no pull request", because that reading
    is what deletes an unpublished branch. A pull request still open is
    retained on too -- the open-pull-request claim asked earlier should have
