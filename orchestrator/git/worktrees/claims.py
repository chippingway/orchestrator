"""What GitHub still says about an issue whose artifacts a host is holding.

The remote half of a reclamation decision. A checkout and a branch on this
host say nothing about whether the work they carry is finished -- only the
issue does, and only its pull requests say whether anybody is still standing
on the branch. Three questions are put here: whether the issue has actually
ended, whether an open pull request still claims one of these branches, and
whether a commit the base does not carry is one a terminal pull request
already accounted for.

Every read is behind its own boundary, and every boundary produces a
retention rather than a raise or a default. A pull-request lookup that failed
is not "no pull request", and an issue that could not be fetched is not an
issue that ended: read either way round, the reclamation runs on the strength
of a question nobody put. The reads are lazy on the wire too -- a PyGithub
object raises from the first attribute touched as readily as from the call
that produced it -- which is why the boundaries are around the use and not
only around the request.

Ending is read strictly. The issue must be closed, and the workflow labels on
it must come to exactly one state, and that state must be `done` or
`rejected`. An issue carrying two of them is one no reading here can settle:
the label vocabulary is what the whole state machine routes on, so an issue
in two states at once is a repository somebody is in the middle of editing,
not a candidate.

    Authenticated because the parse behind it is: the pinned comment is
    matched only when the bot itself wrote it and the body is the state
    marker alone, so a human pasting a state-shaped comment onto the thread
    cannot redirect a reclamation at a branch of their choosing.

    An issue with no pinned comment is a real answer -- the empty state, which
    a candidate the orchestrator never got as far as recording looks exactly
    like. A read that RAISED is not, and it is retained on: the recorded pull
    request and branch live in that comment, so a reclamation that treated an
    unreadable state as an empty one would go looking for neither.

    The payload is checked for being a state at all, because authentication
    does not make it one, and it is checked twice because it can fail to be
    one in two ways. A comment carrying valid JSON the bot wrote -- `[]`,
    `"x"` -- comes back as a `PinnedState` whose data has no `get`, and every
    reader below would raise on it. A comment carrying JSON that does not
    parse comes back EMPTY, which is the shape of an issue nothing was ever
    recorded for: the parser stands `{}` in so a write can overwrite the
    corruption in place, and `parsed` is how it says the payload is a
    substitute rather than a reading.

    Both are `STATE_MALFORMED` rather than `STATE_UNREADABLE`, because what
    an operator does with them differs from what they do with a failed
    request: an API failure clears itself on the next tick, while a corrupted
    pinned comment stays until a human edits it. Spending the substitute as a
    record instead would be the sharper mistake -- the recorded branch and
    pull request are exactly what it does not carry, so a candidate whose
    claims live there would read as a candidate with no claims at all.

    The reason is returned rather than raised, and the issue number comes from
    the candidate rather than off the issue, so that neither the answer nor
    the subject naming it depends on an attribute that can fail on the wire.

    Exact, and it is the commit that makes it so. The lookup is by object id
