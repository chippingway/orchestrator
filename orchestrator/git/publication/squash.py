"""The composed squash-and-publish entry point stage handlers call.

Sequencing the steps is the whole job: `planning` runs every probe while the
branch is still intact, `resume` answers a squash an earlier tick did not
finish, the size gate is entered on the publication the squash is about to
force-push onto, the terms of the rewrite go onto the pinned comment, and only
a plan that survived all of it and carries more than one commit reaches the
destructive `rewrite`. Keeping that order here means no owner has to know when
the next one is safe to run.

The gate sits BEFORE the rewrite deliberately. A squash is one of the pushes
onto a pull request the remote already carries, and the refusals it owes --
a pull request nothing could read, one a human closed mid-review, a tree that
is not provably clean, a head that moved out from under the reading -- are all
answerable while the branch is intact. Asked after the reset instead, every
one of them would cost a rewrite and a rollback to learn.

The recovery sits BEFORE the commit count for the same kind of reason. A
branch a squash already collapsed carries exactly one commit, which is what a
branch with nothing to squash carries too, so reading the count first would
report an unpushed collapse as a success that measured and published nothing.
The record the rewrite wrote before it ran is what tells the two apart, and it
is read before anything is concluded from what is on the branch.

The record itself goes down between the entry and the reset, and both ends of
that window are deliberate. Ahead of the entry it would cost a write for every
publication the pull request refuses; behind the reset there would be nothing
left to write it FROM. A write GitHub refuses stops the squash rather than
letting it run unrecorded: the approved commits stay on the branch, and the
next tick squashes them afresh.

def _squash_and_force_push(gate, branch: str) -> models._SquashOutcome:
    """Squash all commits since `origin/<base>` into one, force-push with lease.

    `gate` is the subject the size gate decides about -- the issue, its pinned
    state, and the checkout -- built by the caller, which is in the layer this
    module would otherwise have to reach up into for it.

    Returns one `_SquashOutcome`, in the four shapes a squash can end in:
      * `success` with `sha` and `count=0` — nothing to squash (zero or one
        commit on top of base). Caller should leave state alone.
      * `success` with `sha` and `count=N>1` — squashed N commits into one.
        `sha` is the new local HEAD; the remote was force-pushed to match.
      * `error` — squash refused, or squash / push failed. Caller parks
        awaiting_human and the remote was not updated. `standing` says where
        that leaves the branch, in one of three: INTACT is the ordinary
        failure, which aborted before anything destructive or restored what it
        rewound, so the original commits are on the branch; COLLAPSED is a
        failure taken over a collapse an earlier tick left, which stays where
        it is because nothing here can prove what putting it back would
        restore; BURIED is a record the branch grew PAST, with the approved
        commits in its own history under whatever was committed on top of
        them; UNKNOWN is a failure this build cannot place at all -- a record
        it cannot read whole, a recorded head no object here answers to, or a
        checkout that would not report its own head.
      * `held` — the size gate took the issue out of this caller's hands.
        Where something durable names the squashed commit -- an oversized
        generation, or a frozen pair whose count never came back -- it stays
        on the branch for the verdict or the reconciliation that answers it;
        on a reading the gate could not take at all it froze nothing, parked
        with its own notice, and the branch was put back where the squash
        found it, so the retry has commits to squash and measure again rather
        than one nobody counted. Either way the caller stops without parking
        and without a handoff.

    A collapse an earlier tick did not finish is answered first, and it is
    answered before the commits on the branch are read as a verdict: the
    record that squash wrote before it ran is the only thing that tells one
    collapsed commit from a branch with nothing to collapse. Nothing is
    resumed on that record's shape alone -- both ends are peeled as objects,
    the history between them is walked against the count, and the commit on
    the branch has to carry the tree the recorded head left. What a proved
    record earns is the publication the interrupted tick owed: resumed under
    the lease it names, finished as a leased no-op where the push already
    landed, and reported with the count only the record still holds -- or the
    branch put back onto the head it names, where nothing durable claims what
    is on it.

    A record that goes down and is never spent is the caller's to drop, not
    this one's: the count on it is what the handoff behind a landed push still
    has to announce, so the write that finishes that handoff is what ends it.

    The publication is entered before anything destructive runs, so a pull
    request nothing could read, one a human closed mid-review, a dirty tree,
    or a head that moved off what this stage read all refuse with the branch
    exactly as the reviewer approved it. The squashed commit is then measured
    like every other candidate for a pull request the remote already carries:
    the tree is the one that was just approved, but the BASE moves, so what
    the branch adds to it is a question only this reading answers -- and this
    is the last push before a human is asked to merge.

    `SQUASH_ON_APPROVAL=off` decides only whether a NEW collapse is made. A
    collapse an earlier tick already made is finished either way -- it is on
    the branch and the remote either has it or does not -- so an install that
    flips the switch between the rewrite and the push does not abandon
    reviewer-approved work off the pull request. An issue with nothing
    recorded costs such an install nothing at all: no probe is run and no
    reading is taken.

    All of it behind the other switch. `DECOMPOSE=off` keeps a squash out of
    the gate entirely: no pull request is read, none of those refusals can be
    taken, and no reading is taken over the commit the squash makes. What such
    an install does is squash and force-push, under the lease this stage read
    for itself and under no other claim about the remote.

    The squash commit subject reuses the first commit's subject when it
    already carries a reusable `<prefix>:` form (Conventional or repo-local,
    so an `event:` / `career:` subject survives); otherwise it builds one
    from the issue title with `_infer_subject_prefix` -- a repo-local prefix
    when recent base history uses one, else `fix`/`feat`. The message is
    subject-only -- no body, no trailers -- so the orchestrator-authored
    squash matches the repo's subject-only commit rule. The commit is
    authored under the AGENT_GIT_* identity (via env vars) so attribution
    matches the per-step commits this squash replaces.

    A branch that never CLAIMED a collapse owes none, and that is the whole of
    what an install with `SQUASH_ON_APPROVAL=off` has always cost: no probe,
    no pull-request read, no write.

    A branch that claimed one owes the entry, because the recovery has just
    dropped that record and only a rewrite would otherwise have asked. The
    record is the claim that a squash was begun here, so a tick that engages
    the recovery, concludes the reset never ran, throws the only evidence
    away, and reports success without ever reading the publication is one that
    hands `documenting` a branch whose remote may have moved out from under
    it. Asked, a pull request somebody closed, merged, or force-pushed refuses
    with the reviewer-approved commits exactly where they are.

    The drop itself stands whichever way that reading goes: the branch still
    carries every commit the record counted, so nothing was collapsed and the
    record is stale however the remote has moved. What the refusal buys is a
    human being told, rather than the divergence being carried into the next
    stage.

    follows and the lease is the second answer to a remote somebody moved;
    here there is no push at all, so a reading skipped is the last thing
    between a publication that has left and `documenting` having the issue.

    And the checkout is proved AGAIN once that reading comes back, for the
    reason the record write is: the read is a REQUEST, so the worktree is
