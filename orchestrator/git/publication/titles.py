"""What a published subject line may say, and which one gets written.

Every surface here answers one question -- what subject the orchestrator
writes on a pull request and on the commit a squash collapses to -- and each
is built from the one below it: the vocabulary says which prefixes count, the
predicates read a line against it, the two history reads supply the lines they
are read on, and the inference and the selection above them decide. A type
added to the list cannot drift from the regex that recognizes it, and a
predicate cannot drift from the caller that picks a title with it.

The history reads are commit MESSAGES, not branch geometry: what is asked of
git here is what past subjects say, so ``probes`` beside this owner keeps the
ahead/behind and fork-point reads and this one never consults them.
