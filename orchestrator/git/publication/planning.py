"""Squash planning: the preconditions gathered before the branch rewrite.

Every probe here runs while the original branch is still intact, so a
failure raises `_SquashPreparationError` and the caller aborts with nothing
to undo. How many commits are on the branch is one of them and is walked
rather than derived from the subjects beside it: a commit written with no
message contributes no subject and is still a commit, so a count taken from
the subjects is short by however many of those there are -- which decides
both whether there is anything to collapse and what a human is told their
history was collapsed from. The plan also pins `original_head` -- the rollback target, the head
the entry takes its lease from, and the commit the gate is told this rewrite
collapsed -- so the rewrite never has to re-read a HEAD its own reset has
already moved.
