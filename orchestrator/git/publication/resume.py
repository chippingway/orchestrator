"""The squash a process died part way through, finished or put back.

A squash is the one rewrite here that leaves the branch unable to say what
happened to it. It collapses the commits a reviewer approved into a single
object with the same tree, so the branch it leaves behind and the branch a
developer simply made one commit on read identically -- and read identically,
the interrupted one takes the nothing-to-squash road and is reported as a
success nobody counted and nothing published, with reviewer-approved work
reaching the merge button neither measured nor on the remote.

What tells them apart is the record the squash wrote before it ran: the head
it was collapsing, the base it was collapsing over, and how many commits went
in. This owner is what reads it back, and what it answers is which of seven
states the branch is actually in.

* An UNTOUCHED original branch. The head the record names is the head the
  checkout is on, so the reset never landed -- the record went down and the
  process died before anything destructive ran. Nothing is owed: the record is
  dropped and the ordinary squash runs over the commits that are still there.
* A branch something MOVED while the collapse was outstanding. The head is no
  longer the one the record names and the branch carries more than one commit,
  so work nobody here made is on it: the recovery owns the tick from the
  moment a record goes down, so no route in this workflow put it there.
  Squashing afresh would collapse that work in with the rest and force-push it
  onto the pull request as history a reviewer approved, so it refuses and
  keeps the claim -- saying which way the branch went, since an operator
  looking for the approved commits finds them under the stray work where the
  recorded head is still reachable and only in the reflog where it is not.
* A branch carrying NOTHING over its base, which is the one shape that road
  could not be trusted with. There is no collapse left to finish and no
  history left to squash, so the retry would report success having measured
  and published nothing while the remote still carries the history the record
  says was collapsed. It refuses instead.
* A squash COMPLETED locally and never pushed. The publication is resumed:
  entered on the recorded head, leased against it, and handed the pair the
  record holds so the transfer that carries an adjudication's exemption is
  decided on the same evidence the interrupted tick would have offered.
* A squash the gate AUTHORIZED -- a permission and a debt naming it -- whose
  push never went out. The same resume, and the permit behind it is re-asked
  in full rather than believed: nothing is remeasured and nothing is
  readjudicated, but nothing is taken on trust either.
* A squash ALREADY PUBLISHED. A durable receipt says this issue's own push put
  the pull request where it stands, so the resume is entered on the rewritten
  commit itself and the publication is the leased no-op it should be -- which
  is what lets the receipt, the debt, and the exemption settle without the
  work being measured or adjudicated a second time.
* A settled receipt whose HANDOFF never finished. The same state one step on,
  and the same answer: the count the record still holds is what the notice and
  the relabel behind this call are owed, and nothing else on the issue has it.

No road here is taken over a tree this host cannot PROVE clean, the one that
hands the branch back to the ordinary squash included. The probes that ran
before this call refuse on what git NAMED, so a status that established
nothing reads to them as a clean tree -- and an install with `DECOMPOSE=off`
reads no pull request either, so nothing behind this would prove one before
the rewrite and the push.

Nothing is resumed on a record's SHAPE alone. A whole-looking record is one
somebody could have written, not one this repository ever produced, so the
three things it claims are proved against the objects before any of it is
acted on: both recorded ends peel to commits this host really holds, the
history between them really is the number of commits the record counts, and
the commit on the branch carries the tree the recorded head left -- which is
what a squash produces, exactly and by construction.
A record that fails any of them leaves the branch untouched and refuses:
every other refusal here knows what the branch is standing on and can put it
back, while this one is the answer to not knowing.

Everything else refuses, and refuses without inventing a repair. A remote
somebody else moved, a pull request a human closed, and a tree that stopped
being provably clean each come back from the publication as the refusal that
reading took, and the branch is put back only where nothing durable names what
is on it -- the same rule a fresh squash's own hold is answered by. A record
this build cannot read WHOLE is refused rather than ignored: a comment
claiming a collapse it cannot produce describes a branch nobody can account
for, and waving it past is precisely the nothing-to-squash road this owner
exists to close.

    Asked BEFORE the count of commits on the branch is read as a verdict,
    because a collapsed branch and a branch with nothing to collapse carry the
    same one commit and only the record tells them apart.

    None is the ordinary answer and means the branch is this call's to squash,
    and it is only ever reached over a record this repository can still show.
    Nothing is decided by comparing the record to the branch first: the ends
    it names are peeled, the pair it claims is proved to be one, the history
    between them is walked against the count, and the tree the classification
    would be made over has to be provably clean. Every road past that -- the
    one that DROPS the record and hands the branch back to the ordinary
    squash included -- rests on it.

    That order is the whole of the safety. A record whose head was edited to
    the commit a finished collapse left reads as a rewrite that never
    happened, so the shortcut for one would drop it and hand on a branch of
    ONE commit -- which is the nothing-to-squash road reporting success over a
    remote still carrying the history the record names. Proved first, the same
    record is refused: the walk between its ends does not come to the number
    it counts.

    The claim this build cannot read whole is the other refusal, and it comes
    first because it is the one thing the proof cannot be taken over. The
    branch it is about may be a completed collapse, and there is no reading
    here that could say: waved past, it is reported as a success that measured
    and published nothing.

    The tree is part of the same proof for a reason the probes ahead of this
    call cannot cover: they refuse on what git NAMED, so a status that
    established nothing reads to them as a clean tree -- and handing on from
    there is what puts an unreadable worktree into a rewrite, since
    `DECOMPOSE=off` reads no pull request and the entry behind it proves no

    branch, and the ordinary squash reads what is there as what it is.

    What tells that shape from the rest is never the commit count on its own:
    a count says nothing about which commits, and every one of these was
    reachable by a record somebody edited as much as by a tick that died. A
    head that matches over a different number of commits is a branch something
    rewrote while the record went on naming its old tip, which is what a
    record edited onto a finished collapse looks like: one commit, counted as
    three.

    A branch with NOTHING over its base is the shape the ordinary squash could
    not be trusted with. There is no collapse left to finish and no history
    left to squash, while the remote still carries every commit the record
    names -- so handed on, the nothing-to-squash road reports success over
    exactly that.

    went, because nothing here can say who moved it. This recovery owns the
    tick from the moment a record goes down, so no route in this workflow
    resumes a developer or publishes over a branch carrying one: something
    outside it did. Squashing afresh would collapse that work in with the rest

    The two are still told apart in the notice, because what an operator does

    of the same question: that one shows the repository can produce what the
    record describes, this one shows the branch is standing on the object that
    describing it would have produced.

    A squash is exact about both things. It rewinds the branch onto the base
    with the index intact and commits it again, so what comes out carries the
    TREE of the head it replaced and has that base as its ONE parent. Neither
    proves it alone. A tree says nothing about the history under it: the same
    tree re-parented onto a base that has since advanced is a commit that
    REVERTS everything that base added, and published on the strength of the
    tree it would take those files off the pull request under an exemption a
    human granted something else. And a parent says nothing about the content.

    So the shape is read whole: the tree the recorded head carries, against
    the tree and the complete parent list of the commit actually on the
    branch. A reading that did not happen refuses, since an unreadable

    account there is of a collapse, so every classification made against one
    -- including "nothing was rewritten, drop it" -- is a claim about objects
    this host either has or has not.

    The TREE comes first because it invalidates the rest: a classification
    made over a checkout nothing could describe is not a classification, and
    the probes ahead of this call refuse on what git NAMED rather than proving
    the opposite.

    Both ENDS are peeled as objects. Git resolves a whole id to itself whether
    or not the store has ever seen it, so an end recorded on another host --
    or one somebody typed -- comes back from a comparison looking exactly like
    a commit that is here. What believing it would buy is a record dropped as
    stale over a collapse nothing can account for, or a push leased against a
    head nobody holds and a transfer decided over a base nothing can produce.

    Then the ANCESTRY between them, because the count behind it is not one. A
    walk between two unrelated histories reports a number like any other, and
    a hand-edited base with the count adjusted to match would read as a whole
    record describing a collapse this branch never had -- so the pair is
    required to be a pair: the base reachable from the head it is said to have
    been collapsed over.

    The COUNT is walked last and is believed no more than the rest. It is the
    one field of the record that is not an object id, so nothing else here
    would catch a value somebody edited -- and what it becomes is the number a
    human is told their history was collapsed from.
