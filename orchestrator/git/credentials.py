"""The per-repository token and the askpass session every git call spends it in.

The lookup, the askpass script, the detached environment, and the record built
from them sit on one owner because they are one decision about a secret: which
repository's token to read, how git is handed it, and how long the file that
prints it lives. A caller resolves a token here and opens a session around it,
and what it gets back is the shape a token-bearing call is spawned from -- a
URL naming the `x-access-token` username and nothing else, an environment
where the token sits as `$GIT_TOKEN` for the askpass script to print, and the
token itself, which the transport reads back to redact its own stderr. Nothing
here puts it in an argv, and that is the guarantee: `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
world-readable and the environment of another user's process is not.

The script lives for exactly the `with` block that opened the session --
written into a private temporary directory, owner-only because /tmp is not,
and removed on exit, so nothing that prints the token outlives the operation
it was written for.

Resolution is per repository rather than per process: a deployment serving
several slugs keeps one token file each, and a call authenticates with the one
belonging to the repo it names.

The two transports -- `branch_transport` and `ref_transport` -- are the only
callers, and each imports this module directly. Nothing republishes these
names, so a test intercepting the session targets the owner that defines it.
