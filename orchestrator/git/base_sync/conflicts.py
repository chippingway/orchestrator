"""Handing a genuinely conflicted auto-rebase to the stage that resolves it.

`resolving_conflict` is reserved for a rebase that actually left conflicted
files, so a merely-behind-base branch the orchestrator can rewrite on its own
never arrives here and the label keeps meaning "a dev agent or a human has to
look at this". The round counter is seeded only when it is absent, because a PR
that keeps re-entering has to exhaust the cap rather than restart it. The
relabel is what hands the work on -- the refresh runs before the handlers in
the same tick, so `_handle_resolving_conflict` picks the worktree up
immediately -- and the pinned state is written after it, so the counter is
committed by the same call that publishes every other durable field.
