"""Whether the refresh may touch a discovered worktree at all, asked in order.

The refresh walks a directory of checkouts knowing nothing about any of them,
so before a rewrite can be considered something has to say which directories
name an issue, whether that issue still reads, and whether anything on it
holds its branch still. Those answers live together because they are one kind
of answer -- a refusal that ends the sync before any rewrite is attempted --
and because the order they are asked in is a property of its own: an
operator's hard-skip comes first, then every record that costs no read of the
checkout, then the read-only conversation stages and the parks they leave
behind, and last the one gate that does pay for a read, so an issue some
cheaper answer already froze never pays for it.

Which records freeze a branch, and what ends each freeze, is the `frozen`
owner's. What is added here is where in that order each is asked and -- for
the two no write ever ends -- whether the stage that still has to act on the
commit holds the issue.

    """Apply dispatcher hard-skips and the conversation stage gate.

    Neither conversation stage builds anything in its checkout, so the tree
    under one of their labels is something to read rather than work in
    progress: an inspection target an unsafe park left for an operator, and --
    in the discussion stage, which keeps its tree on every exit short of the
    terminal that finishes the issue -- the tree the next round opens on.
    Rebasing `origin/<base>` over either would rewrite the state someone was
    parked to look at.

    The discussion stage does push, once: the plan its humans confirmed, on the
    branch and at the SHA its own check read. That is the sharper reason to
    stand down rather than a reason not to. A rebase between that reading and
    the push would move the branch off the commit that was validated, and the
    same rebase after publication would move it off the tip the PR is open
    against and the record vouches for.

    The label answers that only while the stage still holds the issue, so the
    park is consulted beside it. An operator's relabel takes the label away a
    full tick before the implementing guard reads the recorded round tip and
    rules on the branch, and this refresh runs first in that tick: a rebase in
    the gap moves the tip off the anchor and the guard convicts a branch
    nobody touched. Its refusal then asks for a reset back to that same
    anchor, which only hands the next tick the same rebase to redo. The
    checkout therefore stays frozen until the guard's own write clears the
    park, from which tick on the branch syncs normally again.

    The records that freeze a branch on their own, the two parks that freeze
    one with no record behind them, and the two that freeze only while the
    checkout still stands on the commit they name are all the `frozen`
    owner's; what belongs here is where in the order they are asked, and --
    for the last two -- whether the stage that has to act on that commit still
    has the issue.
    A discussion round or publication left in flight freezes the branch on the
    same terms and without any park at all. Those records are written before
    the thing they describe, so a tick that died mid-round leaves one standing
    with `awaiting_human` false -- and the commit it died holding is on the
    branch. Rebasing over it moves the tip off the anchor its own stage will
    measure it against, and on a PR-backed issue the PR-aware route would push
    that rewrite over a plan PR the publication may already have opened.

    Clearing the park does not end the freeze, because the guard replaces it
    with `read_only_baseline_sha` -- the tip it certified, which the dev run
    is measured against until that run commits something. A rebase would move
    the branch off that SHA while the inherited commits it names are still
    there, and the spawn path would then read them as a dev run whose
    publication was interrupted and push them without an agent ever running.
    The baseline is retired the moment there is committed work to publish, so
    this holds for the ticks the dev spends answering rather than building.

    The accepted commit is asked LAST, because it is the only gate here that
    costs a read of the checkout: an exemption on an issue some cheaper answer
    already froze never pays for it.
