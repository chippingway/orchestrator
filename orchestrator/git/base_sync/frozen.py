"""Which records hold a per-issue checkout still, and for how long.

The refresh runs before any handler does, over every worktree that survived
the previous tick, so a record written by a stage that has not run yet is the
only thing standing between `origin/<base>` and a branch somebody is mid-way
through deciding about. What this owner is, is the list of those records and
the rule each one ends by -- because a freeze with no end is a branch that
never sees its base again.

Most of them end by being SPENT: the step that consumes the record drops it,
so the freeze lasts exactly as long as the question it belongs to -- the terms
a squash records before it rewrites the branch among them, dropped by whatever
finishes or undoes that collapse. Three do not, and they are the reason this
is an owner rather than a tuple. An
exemption and a publication record are invalidated by the head moving off them
rather than by any write, so what answers for those is the checkout itself --
and, since neither is ever dropped, how long the STAGE that reads them keeps
the issue, which the `refresh` owner asks beside this one. And two PARKS
freeze a branch with no record the list can find: a size reading nobody could
take, whenever the refusal came before a commit could be named, and an
implementer timeout, whose watermark is a commit that has not been made yet.
Both are answered by the reason the park carries.

# Every record that freezes a branch on its own, whatever the labels and flags
# beside it say: the tip a read-only relabel handed over and has not spent, the
# two a discussion tick leaves while it is mid-flight, the two groups the late
# size gate is deciding by, and the terms of a squash it is mid-way through. They are spelled here the way every pinned
# key this package reads is -- what this gate pins down is how the refresh
# reads state written by stages it never calls into, so a shared constant would
# let a rename pass unnoticed on the side that has to keep understanding it.
# The two discussion records do not depend on `awaiting_human`: an opening
# round leaves the issue unparked by design, so the park read beside this one
# would never see them.
#
# The two late records are the sharpest of the five, because their whole point
# is that a recorded commit is the evidence. An adjudication names one commit,
# measures it against one base, shows an agent the diff between them, and
# publishes or preserves exactly that commit several ticks later; a rebase in
# any of those gaps moves the branch off the SHA every one of those steps acts
# on -- and the reconciliation that noticed would park rather than substitute
# whatever HEAD had become. The candidate is dropped by the write that ends the
# generation, and the approved commit by whichever handoff spends it -- the
# publication that hands the issue to review, or the recovery that republishes
# it -- so both freezes end with the question they belong to, and every field
# written beside either goes with it.
#
# The approved commit picks the candidate's freeze up exactly where it ends. It
# is written by the same write that APPROVES a candidate for publication -- the
# retirement a small one earns, and the exemption a `single` verdict records --
# and the push it licenses runs after that write, so without this the one gap
# left open would be the one where nothing else on the issue names the work at
# all. Past the push its freeze is also the remedy for the park that refuses an
# unpublishable checkout: what settles that park is an operator putting the
# worktree back, and a rebase between their `git checkout` and the tick that
# would have noticed moves the head off that commit again, leaving the park
# with nothing to recover on.
#
# Both are read as GROUPS rather than as the two commits alone, and that is
# what a partial record is answered by. Every key in either group goes down in
# one durable write, so a comment carrying part of one is a comment something
# edited -- and the owner that notices parks the issue rather than acting on
# it. That owner runs at dispatch, which is AFTER this. Held only by the
# commit, a reading whose candidate a hand edit took would be rebased and
# force-pushed while it still named the base it was measured from, the ceiling
# it was measured against, the count, and the publication it was entered on --
# every one of which the retry is bound to -- and a lease with no approval
# beside it names the head a push was owed against and nothing else. So the
# branch is frozen for anything the damage read would refuse, and the park
# lands on a checkout still standing where the record says it is.

# proves the commit on the branch carries the tree the recorded head left,
# which is what a squash produces and what a rebase destroys. Rebased inside
# that window the collapse is gone, the record describes objects the branch no
# longer relates to, and the tick that would have finished it refuses instead
# -- with the pull request still standing on the history the record says was
# collapsed, and the rebase already force-pushed over it.
#
# The freeze ends by being SPENT, like the reading and the approval above:
# whatever ends the collapse drops the record in the same breath -- the reset
# a rollback made, the reset that never ran, and the approval handoff's own
# write past a landed push.
#
# It is read for the key being PRESENT rather than for the value under it, and

# The park a size gate takes on a reading it could not complete. It is here as
# a park rather than as a record because the sharpest of those refusals has no
# record to leave: a revision that would not resolve names no commit, so
# nothing goes on the pinned comment for the list above to find, and the
# branch would be rebased under a park whose whole promise is that the commit
# is still where the developer left it. The retry is bound to what the
# checkout holds -- the exact pair where one was frozen, and a refusal to
# substitute anything where one was not -- and a rewrite in between is what
# makes both unanswerable: the frozen commit is gone, and the checkout the
# refusal was protecting is standing on the base.
#
# A reading lost to the TRANSPORT reaches this reason only once the gate has
# spent the three tries it takes quietly, and what holds the branch through
# those ticks is the reading group above rather than anything here: each of
# those misses writes the frozen candidate back -- with the base beside it
# wherever the reading got that far -- and those are the keys on that list.
# The count it increments is not one of them, and neither is the step a notice
# named. Those two say what happened to a READING; a freeze is held by the
# commits, which are what a rebase takes away and what the retry has to find
# still standing. It is the same division as the paragraph above draws --
# what this reason covers is the refusals that leave no pair to find, and none
# of those is retried quietly at all, because a candidate this host does not
# hold and a diff nothing here can pin answer a second reading exactly as they
# answered the first.
#
# It ends the way every other park does, by being answered, and which road
# does the asking is what says how long the freeze has to hold. PAST
# publication the reconciliation ahead of every handler re-measures the exact
# pair once a poll whatever the park says, so a remote that comes back
# settles it with nothing said on the thread -- and the checkout has to be
# standing where the record left it for every one of those readings, not
# merely for the one that took the park. BEFORE it nothing retakes the
# reading at all: the park owns the tick, and what re-enters the gate is a
# human's own trusted bare continue, however many polls later that is. Either
# window ends the same way if the branch is rewritten inside it -- the frozen
# commit is gone, and the reading that would have ended the park has nothing
# left to take. The retry either takes the reading, hands the issue to the
# developer, or takes the park again with the reason it fails for now.

# commits already on the branch. Every reading of it is a comparison against
# what the checkout has become since.
#
# Which is exactly what a rebase destroys, and destroys most sharply on the
# commonest shape of this park: a run that timed out having committed nothing
# leaves a branch with nothing ahead of base, so a base that advances
# fast-forwards the checkout straight onto the new tip. The head has moved and
# no developer wrote anything, and a recovery reading the difference alone
# would take the base branch for a late-landing commit and publish it as this
# issue's implementation -- a branch and a pull request with no diff in them.
# The proof beside that reading refuses it, and this is the other half: a park
# whose whole promise is that the commit is where the developer left it may
# not have the branch rewritten under it.
#
# It closes the pre-PR half of a hole the PR-aware route never had: that route
# stands down on every `awaiting_human` park whose reason it does not own, so
# a timeout park on an issue with a pull request was already safe. The park
# this is about is the commonest one WITHOUT a pull request -- a first
# implementing run killed before it published anything -- which is precisely
# the route that had nothing asking.

    same head -- which records the rebased commit as one still owed a push,
