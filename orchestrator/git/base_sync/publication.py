"""Force-publishing one clean rebase, and the surfaces it then lands on.

The lease-pinned push is the commit point of the whole auto-rebase: until
the rewritten branch is on the remote, the head the reviewer votes on is
still the pre-rebase SHA. So every check that can still refuse -- an
unreadable HEAD, a rewrite that moved nothing, a tree that came back dirty
-- runs before it and hands off to ``guards``, and the lease itself is
pinned to that same pre-rebase SHA so a foreign update rejects the push
instead of being clobbered. Only an accepted push earns the tail: the PR
notice, the audit event, the `validating` relabel, and last the
`write_pinned_state` that commits the cleared anchor and reset review
round, so a tick that dies partway leaves the anchor pinned for the next
one to recover from.

The rebase is also a REWRITE of whatever the branch was standing on, and on
an issue whose exemption names that commit it is the rewrite that would
punish it: the exemption names one commit and only it, so the replayed
object is measured past the same ceiling and the change a human already
adjudicated goes back into adjudication with a pull request open over it.
So the gate is handed evidence beside the candidate, and ``transfers`` is
what assembles it -- the pair the exemption already records, the pair this
rebase produced, and the publication and pre-rebase anchor the push is made
against. That owner rather than this one, because the recovery that finishes
an interrupted rebase needs the same claim and has no rewrite of its own to
describe. Nothing on either road rules on it: `late_transfer` grants or
refuses the permit, and a refusal simply leaves the ordinary cumulative gate
to measure the rebase like any other candidate, which is what a base advance
that changed the contribution has to get.
