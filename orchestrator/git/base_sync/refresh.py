"""The per-tick base refresh: which worktrees sync, and by which route.

One authenticated fetch of `origin/<base>` per spec feeds every issue
worktree that survived the previous tick, and what runs here is the sequence
that fetch starts: an in-flight scheduler claim keeps a worktree out from
under the worker still holding it, the `refresh_selection` owner beside this
one answers whether the issue behind a discovered directory lets its branch be
touched at all, a dirty pre-PR tree is left alone, and the lag against base
says whether there is anything to carry over.
What survives is routed by whether pinned state already carries a PR --
`pre_pr` rebases the local branch nobody has pushed yet, while the PR-aware
coordinator has to keep the pushed head and the reviewer's SHA in step.

    """Fetch `origin/<base>` once for the spec and bring every existing
    per-issue worktree up to date.

    Runs at the start of each tick so a base-branch update on the remote
    propagates into in-flight issue worktrees. The per-stage
    `_ensure_*_worktree` helpers only fetch base on (re)creation, so a
    worktree that survives across ticks would otherwise stay anchored at
    whatever `origin/<base>` looked like when it was first added.

    Two paths depending on whether a PR already exists for the issue:

    * **Pre-PR worktrees** (no `pr_number` in pinned state): rebase
      the local worktree onto `origin/<base>` -- no remote yet, so there
      is nothing to push.

    * **PR-having worktrees** (validating / documenting / in_review /
      fixing): rebasing
      locally WITHOUT pushing would diverge local HEAD from `pr.head.sha` and
      break the validating reviewer (it reads local HEAD, so it would
      review a SHA that isn't on the PR) and
      `_squash_and_force_push`'s `--force-with-lease=<original_head>`
      (the lease compares against the un-rebased remote tip). So
      `_sync_pr_worktree_to_base` attempts the rebase in the refresh
      itself: on a clean rebase it pushes (force-with-lease pinned to
      the pre-rebase SHA), resets `review_round`, and relabels to
      `validating` so the reviewer re-runs against the rewritten
      branch directly; the single docs pass is deferred to the post-
      approval handoff to `documenting` in `_handle_validating`. Only
      when the rebase actually leaves conflicted files does the issue
      get relabeled to `resolving_conflict` -- the
      `_handle_resolving_conflict` handler then drives the dev agent to
      resolve the conflict. Issues already labeled
      `resolving_conflict` are left alone (the handler runs this tick
      anyway); other labels are skipped (no PR worktree to refresh in
      those states).

    Rebase keeps the PR history linear after sibling PRs land. Every
    pushed rebase resets `review_round`, so the reviewer must re-run
    against the rewritten SHA before any merge gate can pass.

    Conflicts on the pre-PR path abort the rebase so the worktree stays
    on its original SHA -- conflict resolution still belongs to
    `_handle_resolving_conflict`. Dirty worktrees are skipped so a
    crash-recovered tree with uncommitted edits is never disturbed
    (mirrors `_on_dirty_worktree`'s rule). All failures are logged at
    info/warning and swallowed: keeping every issue moving matters more
    than perfect base sync.

    `scheduler`, when supplied, is consulted before each per-issue
    worktree sync: an issue whose handler is currently in flight in
    that scheduler is skipped this tick. Without this gate, a polling
    pass can rebase a pre-PR worktree under a still-running agent or
    relabel/state-mutate a PR worktree while its handler is still
    running, racing the base refresh against the live worker. The
    scheduler's `submit` path also rejects a duplicate active issue,
    so the workflow handler itself does not run for the in-flight
    issue this tick -- the refresh skip keeps the worktree contract
    matching that "active issues are skipped until completion"
    guarantee. `None` preserves the legacy behavior so direct test
    invocations that supply no scheduler still refresh every worktree.
