"""Rebasing one issue worktree onto its base, and the pre-PR path that runs it.

Every command here goes through the hardened git envelope because the
worktree is agent-writable: even the read-only unmerged-path probe would
otherwise execute a planted hooksPath or fsmonitor under the orchestrator's
UID. The pre-PR path is the only caller that may abort on conflict and leave
the worktree on its original SHA -- nothing is pushed yet, so no remote head
depends on the rewrite and conflict resolution can wait until a PR exists.
The rebase-state probes are published for the conflict stage, which asks
whether a worktree still sits mid-rebase before it parks one.
