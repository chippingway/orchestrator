"""Issue-state vocabulary, label writes and history, comments, and children.

The issue-state vocabulary lives here -- the attribute PyGithub carries it on
and the values it takes -- because it is the GitHub wire spelling, not a
workflow one: every reader that asks whether an issue is still open, and every
writer that closes one, has to spell it the way the API does -- the poller and
the two terminal owners included. The swept label sets sit beside it for the
reason the dispatcher reads them from here as well: which closed issues are
still owed a pass is a statement about issue state, not about how one walk
over a repository is taken.
