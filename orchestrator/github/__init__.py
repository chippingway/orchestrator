"""The package API the PyGithub client is reached through.

Each domain surface lives in its own owner module: the workflow / control label
vocabulary in ``labels``, audit records in ``events``, issue polling and writes
in ``issues``, the durable pinned state in ``pinned_state``, pull requests in
``pull_requests``, review verdicts and feedback watermarks in ``reviews``, and
check surfaces in ``checks``; ``client`` composes them into the concrete
``GitHubClient``. This initializer re-exports the narrow public surface
(``__all__``): that client and the pinned durable-state model. Code that needs a
single domain surface imports its owner directly, so nothing private is
published here.

Importing the ``client`` owner here pulls the whole mixin chain, whose leaves
reach back into this package for their sibling owners. Those leaf imports name
submodules rather than names bound here, and a submodule import binds on the
parent package even while this initializer is still running, so importing any
owner first never needs a name this module has not bound yet.
