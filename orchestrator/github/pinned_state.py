# the bot is IDENTIFIED as a corrupted state comment rather than passed over
# as no state at all -- the parser then refuses it, and a caller that would
# have read the miss as "this issue recorded nothing" is told otherwise.

    comment's terminator would close it early and leave everything after it --
    the rest of the record, whatever a stage happens to have written -- as
    visible issue text. Values are not this owner's to sanitize: an agent's

    the payload changes, and a body written before this reads back the same.

    issue never paid them. One accepted at the ceiling with terminators in it
    -- a preserved pull-request body is where they come by the thousand --
    escapes into a comment GitHub refuses, and the write that would carry it
    is the write a stage's park, its notice, or its recorded outcome rides out

    is what a later tick reads, while the escape only decides how the comment
    LOOKS. So a payload the escape puts past the limit is written exactly as
