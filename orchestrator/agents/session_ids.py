"""The session id a resume is issued against, read off any backend's output.

Which session a run belongs to is the one question asked of BOTH CLIs, and it
is asked structurally: a UUID-shaped value at a known key, anywhere in the
event tree, whatever shape the backend wrapped it in. That is why the walk
lives apart from the `sessions` owner beside it -- those parsers read Claude's
stream schema by name, while this one is deliberately typed by no backend and
stays correct for output neither CLI has published yet.
