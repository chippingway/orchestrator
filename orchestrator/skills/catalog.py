"""Per-tick repo skill-catalog collection.

Enumerates the skill definitions a configured target repo carries on its
base ref and appends one `repo_skill_catalog` analytics record per tick
per spec via `recording.record_repo_skill_catalog`. Producer-side only:
the record lands in the analytics JSONL sink (and, once synced, the
`extras` JSONB of `analytics_events` -- no DDL), so the consumer /
dashboard side stays a separate change.

Both skill roots `discovery` defines are scanned, and only *direct*
`<root>/<name>/SKILL.md` definitions count: a `SKILL.md` nested any deeper
(e.g. `.claude/skills/.system/<name>/SKILL.md`) or not under a known root is
ignored, mirroring the names-only trigger anchor in
`observability/usage/skill_commands.py`. Skills are deduped by name across
both roots; every source path that produced a name is preserved under
`skill_paths`, and every name is classified `project` under `skill_levels` --
what this scan reads is a repository's own checked-in definitions, so the
level `discovery` stamps a worktree root with is the level this enumeration
can report without inspecting anything further.

Dashboard-local skill files are never scanned: enumeration reads the
target repo's base ref via `git ls-tree`, not the orchestrator's own
working tree. The whole producer is fail-open -- a missing clone, an
unfetched ref, a git error, or a sink IO failure logs and is swallowed so
catalog collection never disturbs the polling tick. `workflow/engine/tick.py`
names this owner and calls `_emit_repo_skill_catalog` once per tick per spec,
after `_refresh_base_and_worktrees` has refreshed `<remote_name>/<base_branch>`.
