# Usage parser

Pure-Python helpers that decode the JSONL stdout `agents.AgentResult` carries into a `UsageMetrics` dataclass —
backend, distinct model(s), turn count, input / output / cached / cache-read / cache-write token totals, `cost_usd`, and
a `cost_source` tag of `reported` / `estimated` / `unknown-price` / `no-usage`. No external dependency: the parser is
jq-free.

The pass runs once the audit `agent_exit` event has already fired, and `record_agent_exit` writes what it returns as
the token / cost detail on the analytics [`agent_exit` record](event-streams.md#agent_exit-records) and the
`run_usage` summary on the [trajectory record](trajectories.md#trajectory-sink-trajectory_log_path). Two siblings ride
the same stream under the same resilience contract: the opt-in skill-trigger extractor and the trajectory classifier
below. None of the three reads or writes a file — redaction, truncation, and the append itself belong to the writers
downstream of them.

Where the parser sits in the package tree, and what it is responsible for beside the surfaces around it, is in
[`architecture/observability-modules.md`](../architecture/observability-modules.md); the knobs are in
[`configuration/observability.md`](../configuration/observability.md).

**Module layout.** The package initializer is the public surface: under a narrow `__all__` it re-exports the nine
parsers `metrics.py`, `skills.py`, and `trajectory.py` define, a per-backend trio each, plus the five result types they
hand back — `UsageMetrics` and `SkillTriggers` from the first two, and `AgentTrajectory` / `TrajectoryStep` /
`TurnUsage` from `trajectory_models.py`. Provider payload handling is split behind them: `protocol.py` holds the JSONL
vocabulary and `event_stream.py` the resilient line decoder, `prices.py` the first-party price tables and
`model_names.py` the nested model-name lookup, `claude_rows.py` / `claude_summary.py` and `codex_rows.py` /
`codex_summary.py` the per-provider frame decoding and run summary, `shell_segments.py` / `skill_commands.py` /
`skills_claude.py` / `skills_codex.py` the skill-evidence classification, and `trajectory_claude_blocks.py` /
`trajectory_claude_stream.py` / `trajectory_claude_turns.py` plus `trajectory_codex.py` and the per-item-type
`trajectory_codex_items.py` under it the timeline reconstruction. The
trajectory classifier reuses the same event decoder, pricing path, and skill evidence owners, so the resilience and
cost-precedence contracts are defined once. Each published name is bound once at import to its owner's own object, and a
binding does not follow a later patch, so a test intercepting a parser targets the module its caller imported — every
live caller names the owner it is typed by, and no flat module sits beside the package to resolve one through.

**Two parsers, one dispatcher.** `parse_claude_usage(stdout)` consumes claude `--output-format stream-json` events,
groups assistant frames by `message.id` so the final-frame usage wins (claude streams partial counts on intermediate
frames), and sums per-model. `parse_codex_usage(stdout, fallback_model=None)` consumes codex `--json` events and treats
usage as cumulative across the session: the *last* non-zero usage record is the authoritative total.
`parse_agent_usage(backend, stdout, fallback_model=None)` dispatches by backend string the same way `agents.run_agent`
does.

**Cost precedence.** A `total_cost_usd` reported by the CLI itself always wins (`cost_source="reported"`); otherwise the
parser walks first-party Anthropic / OpenAI price tables baked into the module and produces an estimate (`"estimated"`).
When usage is present but the model SKU does not match any priced family, the parser returns
`cost_source="unknown-price"` and `cost_usd=None` rather than guess at zero or bill cached tokens at the input rate. An
empty stream — or one with no usage frames at all — yields `"no-usage"`.

**Resilience.** Malformed JSON lines (banner text, truncated frames, partial flushes) are silently skipped so a single
bad line never invalidates the rest of the stream. `_run_agent_tracked` (in `workflow/engine/usage.py`) calls
`parse_agent_usage` after every tracked agent run and appends the parsed counts to the
[analytics sink](event-streams.md#analytics-sink-analytics_log_path) under `event="agent_exit"`; a
parser exception is caught and downgraded to a `log.exception`.

**Terminal verdict surface.** Beyond the analytics sink, `_accumulate_issue_usage` (in `workflow/engine/usage.py`,
beside `_run_agent_tracked`) folds each run's
`UsageMetrics` into per-issue counters on the pinned state (`issue_agent_runs` / `issue_total_tokens` /
`issue_total_cost_usd` / `issue_cost_sources`; see [state-machine/labels-and-state.md][pinned-state]). When an
issue reaches a terminal, `_format_issue_usage_verdict` renders those counters into one visible receipt line
posted on the issue thread — `:receipt: this issue: N agent runs · T tokens · $X.XX`, with `(est.)` appended when any
run's cost was `estimated` and the figure collapsed to `unknown` when an `unknown-price` run leaves the total
incomplete. The PR merged / rejected finalizers and the closed-`question` terminal post it as a standalone tracked
comment; the `umbrella` close comment appends it. It is a read-only summary — nothing gates on the figure — and it is
skipped when no run was ever counted.

**Skill-trigger extractor (opt-in).** A sibling trio mirrors the usage parsers' two-parsers-one-dispatcher shape and
resilience contract to record which agent *skills* a run loaded, gated behind `TRACK_SKILL_TRIGGERS` (default off;
see [`agent_exit` records](event-streams.md#agent_exit-records)). The result is a names-only
evidence model on `SkillTriggers`: `triggered` / `trigger_counts` are the loaded skills, `evidence` maps each to its
tier (`confirmed` / `inferred`), and `incidental` / `incidental_counts` are path-only references that never become
loads. The two buckets are independent —
a skill both read and inspected is recorded in both — the only exclusion is structural: an incidental reference never
enters `triggered` / `trigger_counts` or the `skill_triggered` audit events. `parse_claude_skills(stdout)` reads the
firm **confirmed** signal — `tool_use`
content blocks named `Skill` in the `assistant` stream — and returns `input.skill` in first-seen order, de-duplicating
per invocation by the block `id`. (A captured real stream showed that under `--include-partial-messages` each completed
content block lands in its own `assistant` frame — the content array is partitioned across frames, not a cumulative
snapshot that repeats earlier blocks the way the `usage` sub-object does — so the parser walks every frame and de-dups
by `id` rather than keeping the last frame per message id.) Claude has no dedicated file mechanism, so it produces no
incidental references. `parse_codex_skills(stdout)` recognizes the codex shape: codex has no dedicated `Skill` tool, so
its file-based skill mechanism surfaces only as a `command_execution` item whose shell `command` opens a skill's
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file (codex's own "open its SKILL.md" instruction). A captured reviewer run pinned this — codex
both registered-under-`$CODEX_HOME/skills/` and project-local `.agents/skills/` reads match. The command is first
unwrapped (peeling the `bash -lc "…"` shell) and split into sub-commands on **unquoted, unescaped** operators —
quote- and backslash-aware, so a metacharacter inside a quoted argument (`rg 'foo|bar' path`) or a backslash-escaped one
(`rg foo\|cat path`) does not fabricate a spurious segment — then each `SKILL.md` match is routed by its sub-command's
leading verb (skipping any `NAME=value` env prefix). Only a verb
established as a **direct reader** (`cat` / `sed` / `head` / …) makes the reference an **inferred** load; every other
verb — an inspection / search (`git diff` / `git status` / `rg`), an env-prefixed inspection (`GIT_PAGER=cat git
diff …`), or a generic path-only command (`echo …`) — makes it an **incidental** reference. Even a reader verb is
demoted to incidental when the `SKILL.md` is *written* rather than read: an output-redirect target
(`cat t > .agents/skills/x/SKILL.md`) or a non-reading mode (`sed -i` / `--in-place`) is an incidental reference, so a
skill file a run only writes is never miscounted as a load. So a read chained after an inspection still counts, and a
bystander `git diff` over a changed SKILL.md does not fabricate a load. Started/completed
echo the same command, so the parser dedups by the shared `item.id` (last-frame-wins, as for usage) — for inferred
loads and incidental references alike. It reads only the `<name>` path segment and the routing verb — never the command
text or its `aggregated_output` (the file's contents), both of which can echo user content (names-only Privacy). The
inferred signal stays **heuristic** within the reader allowlist: a reader that opens a SKILL.md for an unrelated reason
would still register as an inferred load, while defaulting non-readers to incidental keeps an unrecognized command from
fabricating a trigger. `parse_agent_skills(backend, stdout)` dispatches by backend exactly as `parse_agent_usage` does.
The offered-skills set (`SkillTriggers.available`) is
**confirmed on claude** — read from the dedicated `skills` array in the `system`/`init` frame, captured against a real
stream — and
stays **empty on codex** at the parser layer: a captured `codex exec --json` stream (v0.142.5) carries no offered-skills
frame at all, so `record_agent_exit` backfills the codex offered set out-of-band from the filesystem via
`skills.discovery.discover_local_skills(cwd)` instead. The *triggered* set does not
depend on it either way. As with the usage parsers, malformed JSONL lines are skipped and a missing / renamed field
yields an empty result rather than an exception. Only the skill *name* is ever read — never the `Skill` tool's `args`
(Privacy).

**Trajectory classifier.** A third sibling trio mirrors the same two-parsers-one-dispatcher shape and resilience
contract to reconstruct a run's *trajectory* — the ordered timeline of tool calls / results interleaved with the
assistant / user text turns — into an `AgentTrajectory` dataclass: `backend`, a best-effort `system_prompt` / `tools`,
the names-only `skills` (`SkillTriggers`), an ordered `steps` tuple of `TrajectoryStep` (`kind` is `"tool_call"` /
`"tool_result"` / `"assistant_message"` / `"user_message"`, with `name` / `tool_id` / raw `content` — `name` /
`tool_id` empty on the text turns — plus a `turn` index tying each billed step back to the assistant turn that
produced it), `final_output`, and a best-effort `turns` tuple of per-turn token usage (`TurnUsage`, parallel to `tools`
/ `skills` and claude-only today). `parse_claude_trajectory(stdout)` reads the offered tools from the `system`/`init`
frame's `tools` array, then the ordered timeline: assistant `text` blocks become `assistant_message` turns and
`tool_use` blocks `tool_call` steps; user `text` blocks become `user_message` turns and `tool_result` blocks
`tool_result` steps — calls / results joined by `tool_use_id` and de-duplicated per id the same way
`parse_claude_skills` is, while id-less text blocks ride claude's per-completed-block framing — and the final answer
from the `result` frame's `result` string. It also groups those assistant frames by `message.id` in first-seen order to
assign each a 0-based `turn` index — stamped onto the `assistant_message` / `tool_call` steps that frame produced (a
`tool_result` / `user_message` step is a turn *input*, not billed output, so its `turn` stays `None`) — and emits one
`TurnUsage` per turn: `model`, `input_tokens` / `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens` / `cache_write_tokens` (the 5m + 1h
cache-creation buckets summed), and an always-*estimated* `cost_usd` / `cost_source` (`"estimated"`, or
`"unknown-price"` with `cost_usd=None` for an unpriced SKU — a reported `total_cost_usd` is a run-level figure and
never reaches a turn). The per-turn estimate reuses the same `claude_estimate_cost` price path on
`observability/usage/prices.py` as the run aggregate, so the per-turn figures stay in lock-step with
`parse_claude_usage`'s run totals. `parse_codex_trajectory(stdout)` normalizes each
operational item codex reports into one `tool_call` and, when the stream actually carried an outcome, one
`tool_result` beneath it, and each `agent_message` item into one `assistant_message` turn (its `text`). Codex emits
several frames per item — `item.started`, any `item.updated`, then `item.completed` — so every item is correlated by
its `item.id` and a frame contributes only the fields it carried, which is what collapses a started/completed pair
into a single pair of steps and lets the completing frame name what the started one had not resolved yet. The
supported item types and the fields each pair is built from are: `command_execution` (its `command`, then the
`aggregated_output` of the frame that completed it — a *running* command already reports that field, empty, so
presence alone would credit a command still running with a result it never produced), `mcp_tool_call` (its
`arguments`, then its `result` — or its `error` when the server filled that instead — under a `<server>.<tool>` step
name), `web_search` (its `query`, then the `action` it resolved to), and `file_change` (its `changes`, then the
status it settled on). That last one is codex's **custom** (freeform) tool surface: the model calls `apply_patch`,
and the stream reports the call and its outcome as a `file_change` item, so a custom tool call normalizes to a pair
like any other. `codex exec --json` publishes no separate custom / dynamic tool item type — its whole item vocabulary
is `agent_message`, `reasoning`, `command_execution`, `file_change`, `mcp_tool_call`, `collab_tool_call`,
`web_search`, `todo_list`, and `error` (verified against codex-cli 0.148.0), and `custom_tool_call` is a raw
model-response / rollout spelling that never reaches this stream. A `web_search` item serializes `id` twice, the
provider's own `exec-…` call id last, so that call id is what the decoder hands the parser and what a search is
correlated and recorded under; every other item is correlated under the synthetic `item_N` the exec stream numbers
its items with. The id is also what keeps one operation one item: a wrapper frame reporting the id of the call
nested inside it merges into that call rather than doubling it, and a wrapper of a type nothing normalizes neither
replaces the normalized pair with a placeholder nor adds one beside it. The final answer is read from the last
`agent_message` `text`; `turns` stays empty with every `step.turn` `None`, since codex usage frames are cumulative
across the session rather than per-turn. Both reuse the
matching skill extractor for the `skills` field. `parse_agent_trajectory(backend, stdout)` dispatches by backend exactly
as the usage / skill dispatchers do. `system_prompt` stays `None` and `tools` stays empty in the classifier whenever a
backend's stream does not expose them (codex exposes neither); the analytics writer backfills codex `tools` out-of-band
from `skills.discovery.discover_codex_tools()`. Malformed JSONL lines are skipped and a missing / renamed field
yields an empty section rather than an exception. Unlike the skill extractor, this classifier records the **raw** stream
payload — tool inputs, tool outputs, and the final text — verbatim: it deliberately does **not** redact, truncate,
or write any file. Those concerns belong to its downstream writer,
`observability/analytics/trajectories/`'s `persistence.maybe_record_trajectory`
(called from `record_agent_exit`), which redacts every free-text field, applies the head/tail and total-record
truncation caps, and appends the `agent_trajectory` record to the
[trajectory sink](trajectories.md#trajectory-sink-trajectory_log_path) — only when
`TRAJECTORY_LOG_PATH` is enabled and always behind its own fail-open guard.

**Codex item types beyond those four.** Nothing is dropped silently. An item type the classifier does not normalize —
codex's `todo_list` plan updates and its `collab_tool_call` today, whatever a later release adds tomorrow — becomes one
bounded `unsupported_item` placeholder step naming the item `type`, its id, and the `status` it reported, deduplicated
by `item.id` the same way a tool pair is and carrying no payload of its own. `reasoning` is the one deliberate
exclusion: its text is hidden model content that never enters a record, and a placeholder per reasoning item would be
noise rather than a diagnostic. Nothing fabricates an outcome either — a call that failed, or one the stream never
completed, keeps its `tool_call` with no `tool_result` under it unless a frame actually reported one.
